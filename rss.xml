&lt;p&gt;Why is it that we can see something coming and still not prepare? I’ve been asking myself this the past 10 days that we’ve been on lock-down here in Denmark. While we set ourselves up pretty well (how is besides the point here), we set ourselves up in a very general way. We have some medical supplies and training, we have food, we can keep ourselves and our son protected… we think. But what if we could be more specific?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was this question that spurred my wife &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.aylanewhousedesign.com/&quot;&gt;Ayla&lt;/a&gt; (a design director at Fjord) and I (design all-arounder and co-design consultant) to do what we have consistently done in our relationship: turn to goddamn post-it notes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We realized that we needed a different tool to deal with this complexity, and so we created a game. It’s not — strictly speaking — a particularly fun game. It’s not dealing with a particularly fun topic. But it follows that structure and it was (and is) useful to us. &lt;strong&gt;This is a long post: if you want to jump to the rules and the tools we created, just head to the end.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Anxiety, Collected&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our first task was to enumerate our anxieties. That was fun.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;figcaption class=&quot;gatsby-resp-image-figcaption&quot;&gt;We started off just listing everything we could think of&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sickness and death in our family (all on another continent), our son Emil getting sick, losing our job(s), overwhelmed public health systems, closed borders, and economic bailouts failing were the obvious near term concerns. Greater extremes came quickly after: governments focusing on their citizens above foreigners (we’re foreign workers in Denmark), seized assets. Even broader: what of a European Union unable to fulfill its “union” mandate? What of existing fragility and its fallout, such as armed conflict between Turkey and Russia?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These anxieties are overwhelming when taken together, and can quickly spiral. I’d argue they are effectively the same as reaching out frantically in the dark from ones current position. What we needed is a way to tackle these anxieties in sequence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the past, we’ve often use a tool like &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backcasting&quot;&gt;backcasting&lt;/a&gt;: looking at a future or point in time that we WANTED to get to, and figuring out what are the steps required to get there. But we aren’t in that kind of situation. &lt;strong&gt;We aren’t defining a strategy so much as developing a posture from which to engage whatever the world is throwing at us in a time of extreme uncertainty.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We want to build our resilience. We know (insomuch as one can) where we are right now: so what does it mean to scout forwards in time?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Anxiety, Organized&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our next step was to simply cluster the anxieties where they seem to make sense. A few obvious ones emerged:&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Environment&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These were things like “one of us gets sick”, “Emil gets sick”, or “One of us loses our job.” Events that we are living with in a time of change or decision making. Something that is probably traumatic, but also something that frankly most of us will be experiencing in some way over the coming months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Resources&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These started as inflection points, things like “hospitals get filled to capacity”, “No testing means no idea of actual risk”, and “Internet rationing or curfews.” But these clusters could be simplified down to “Public Health”, “Risk Appetite”, and “Community and Connection” respectively. Either private or public resources that shape outcomes. There’s a cluster of other ones as well, including Cash, Consumables and Food, Sanity, etc. Ultimately, anything that is a resource in balance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Inflection Point&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inflection Points are specifically in tension with the Environment category, and have a lot of overlap. These are mostly framed as a CHANGE that we will have to make a decision around. An example we listed is that “Denmark starts emphasizing Danish citizens over foreigners for medical care” (unlikely but possible), “Indefinite Lockdown is announced”, and “No one is Hiring.” In each of these cases, it requires a non-obvious response given the reality we find ourselves in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Catastrophe&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, we have a “catastrophe” category, which is something that throws an already vulnerable situation into complete chaos. This might be the death of a parent or partner, assets being frozen (for whatever reason), a national or international crisis, or — most likely — a full recession. Significantly, these are things that might actually be quite probable: but their likelihood doesn’t dilute the extreme emotional, financial, physical, and psychological impact of the event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Anxieties, Iterated&lt;/h2&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, one axis became time extending from now, +3mo, +6mo, +12mo, + 18mo, and +36 months. Then the other axis became the the “order” of decision: environment to resources, resources to inflection point, inflection to catastrophe with the two assessments beside it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Setting the Scene&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, &lt;strong&gt;Environment&lt;/strong&gt; cards were chosen based off of what we were facing right now. (We started with one of us being sick, though hopefully we aren’t). Then looked at the &lt;strong&gt;resources&lt;/strong&gt; that we had access to and what we were lacking. In the above scenario, we’re well set up for supplies and consumables, but honestly, don’t feel well covered by the the public health system. This is an entirely subjective judgement: we might actually be well covered, but it’s just the feel there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, we move on to the &lt;strong&gt;Inflection Point&lt;/strong&gt;, which in this case is the made-up “Denmark explicitly emphasizes Danish citizen wellbeing over foreign residents.” This being purely speculative, we wanted to explore what would happen.&lt;/p&gt;

After we laid out these four cards, along the “Now” time, we asked ourselves: “Okay, what would we do?” And at this first assessment, there actually wasn’t much. Even in a scenario where we were sick and our health as foreign workers was being devalued, we’re healthy, have resources, and have a community. So we decided that we’d simply stay home, and try to weather this sickness as best we can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Second Assessment&lt;/h3&gt;

    &lt;figcaption class=&quot;gatsby-resp-image-figcaption&quot;&gt;The second assessment canvas&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
Then we rolled a dice. Each of our catastrophy cards we had labeled with a number, since for this initial exercise we only had a few. And it rolled a 4: “A Death In the Family.” &lt;strong&gt;This was the moment where the game hit home and we both said “Fuck” in unison.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a scenario where our own health was at risk and we had made the decision to shelter in place, suddenly our sibling or our parent calls us with crushing news. We’re between an 8 and 12 hour flight back — itself a multiple of risk to ourselves, our loved ones, and those whose paths are simply coincident with our own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is where the second assessment took place. We listed what would likely have to happen: hunker in place. Look after our physical health. Look after our mental health. Find a grief councillor who can work with us remotely. Redouble our efforts to stay connected with family. Take on the responsibility of planning and estate considerations, or support the family member who does.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Next Turn&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exhausted by this, we drew the next card: 3 months from now, in June. Suddenly, one of us is unemployed. We select our resources: we have good savings, but in such a situation our risk tolerance is going to drop (meaning why might not be able to jump on opportunities like we had in the past). Then a corresponding inflection point: “No one is hiring.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We laid out our first assessment, which actually did not look too different from what we would do outside of a pandemic and looming recession. But the catastrophe card threw this into stark relief: the borders were fully locked down. Suddenly, even though we had not been planning a move, the scope of potential forward actions dramatically shrunk. Maybe the embassy? What do we do?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Anxieties, Acknowledged&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We played several rounds of this, seeing another family member pass, seeing cabin fever set in, and finally seeing both of us face unemployment. Each of these turns as the marched forward in time prompted stark decision making and discussions on what might come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, we looked at our decisions and took stock — what comes next? If these things might happen, what can we do now to offset the risk? If joblessness is a likelihood (or at least distinct possibility), can we plan our capital and budget accordingly now as though we anticipate that? If the death of a family member is possible in the near term instead of the indeterminate future, what needs to happen?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This wasn’t a fun game.&lt;/strong&gt; It was upsetting, painful, and anxiety inducing. But though crudely simulating what might come, it helped map out many of the blindspots and fragilities we’ve had all along. And maybe, if we run through a few more times, it’ll mean we’re in a better posture when the time to act comes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Rules of Play&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay. The above was a long diatribe about why we made this. Here’s the TL;DR on the rules and how to play.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Setup the Board&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;List out everything you’re thinking about on posits or small squares of paper.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Organize into:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Environment (something ongoing, like sickness or unemployment)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Resources (cash, community, etc)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Inflection (an event that forces a decision)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Catastrophe (something big and unexpected)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wildcard (Something possible but very unlikely, like a shooting war between Russia and Turkey or the EU collapsing)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Create two axis:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;one of time starting from now,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;one with environment, positive resource, negative resource, inflection, catastrophe, wildcard. Then two more columns: Assessment 1, Assessment 2&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/f87d372c75f53c5a605f786953391152/canvas.pdf&quot;&gt;You can download the canvas here&lt;/a&gt;
We didn’t play with the wildcards initially, so didn’t include that on the canvas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;First Round&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Select an “Environment,” either what you’re must worried about now or what is already the case. Put that on “Now” and “Environment”. Then select two resource cards for what you have access to (positive) and what you are missing (negative). Then select a random inflection card.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Think about what you would do in this scenario and discuss. What do you hope you’d have? What kind of decision would you make? Write it down on a posit and put it in assessment #1.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Then roll a dice or select a catastrophe card at random. Put it in the catastrophe slot.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reflect and discuss on the new scenario given your previous decision. What changes? What can you do? How bad are things? What opportunities might exist? Write down your reflection and put it in assessment 2.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Normally the round is over, but if you want to add something, add an additional wildcard and an assessment #3.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Subsequent Rounds&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each round builds on the last, so if your next time slot is three months from now, then it is following the decisions you made in the “Now” timeslot. Simply follow the same steps as the first round and see where it takes you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Reflection&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Play until you feel like you have an idea of what might come. Before wrapping up, look at your assessments. What can you learn in terms to preparing for some of these worst cases now? Is there anything you need? Decisions you need to make? Process to put in place?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then if you like, play another round with a different starting point. Who knows what different decisions you might make, and what you might discover you’ll need on the other side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Resources&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;

With the coronavirus probably hitching a ride in one of your co-workers, it’s possible that your work (especially if you exist in that oh-so-nebulous world of knowledge work) is implementing a more permissive remote work policy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of you will think “I can’t do that.” Many of you might be right, since a lot of very real, outcome-driving work happens in the interstitial space between “actual work” and socializing.  But I would suggest that there is a  balance to be struck that will allow you to work remotely or mostly remotely, thereby reducing your risk of exposure (or at least &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2020/3/6/21161234/coronavirus-covid-19-science-outbreak-ends-endemic-vaccine&quot;&gt;flattening the curve&lt;/a&gt; so that local healthcare systems don’t get overwhelmed).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve been working mostly remotely since mid 2017, when I realized with a bit of a shock that the fellowship I had accepted was for a remote team. Turns out it works out well, but oh my god, was the learning curve painful. Currently, I work mostly remotely as a product manager, a job that I would not have guessed would  fit that mode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So here are a few tips on the remote work thing, with the goal of inspiring you to give it a try.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Create an Accountability Structure&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the biggest thing and also should be table stakes. Some folk have intense internalized accountability, and they might just get the work done because of fear, pride, whatever. I’m not one of those. I am both very goal-oriented and very exploration-motivated, so I’ll work frantically and gleefully, but my attention will turn on a dime without some accountability structure to keep it in place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For me, what I found worked best was consistent deadlines and dramatic transparency about responsibilities. Every week I broadcast to the team my goals, deadlines, and expected outcomes as a baseline, and then run my team’s product specific standup. I also keep a lot of documentation. 90% of that isn’t read until it’s needed, or not at all, but the act of documenting helps makes things concrete, and it’s a motivator for me knowing its done and making it public to the team. Currently, I run the documentation with Notion, where I keep everything from year-scoped strategy, to feature specs and data models, to weekly notes and to-do lists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Over Communicate, but Not Like That&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Language by itself is low bandwidth. The reason why face-to-face meetings are so vital is that trust is built through being in the room, showing openness, communicating physically, demonstrating emotion, taking risk, etc. There’s a lot communicated outside of just words. Unfortunately, one of those things might be coronavirus. So let’s compromise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can work remotely and still have high bandwidth communication. &lt;em&gt;What you shouldn’t do is be a sociopath on Slack&lt;/em&gt;. Not everything needs to be liked, but communication and requests DO need to be acknowledged. Not everyone needs to see the gif, but sometimes a gif drives the point home. Basically, focus on the quality of your communication and the context that it creates, instead of becoming a one-human version of the PRC’s surveillance state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A concrete example: your team’s engineer shares what she just pushed to staging, asking for feedback. You acknowledge and give a timeframe for feedback, so expectations are set. Somewhere in that time period, give it a look. Instead of just rambling off feedback in slack, make a list. Open a notes application (I use BearApp) or your issue tracking software, and make a list of what you’re seeing. Maybe take some screenshots, maybe record a screencast of a bug. Copy and paste your feedback (or links to the feedback) into a slack thread responding to the request, and tag the engineer in your response so she knows that the feedback is there. Probably you’ll have a discussion about it. Probably everything will move on easily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this case, the communication is focused, high quality, but also flexible enough to respond to the needs of the problem and is pretty damn fast. When so much of communication is performance, the thing you need to be “performing” when working remotely is competence and a focus on outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Take Your Damn Breaks and Put On Some Pants&lt;/h2&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
Once you get used to working remotely and find your stride, it can be very, very easy to suddenly wake up on the other side of the day with a brilliantly demolished to-do list, but no clothes and a hole where lunch was supposed to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love the experience of being so engrossed in making something, I don’t even notice time and the world passing by. That’s gotten a bit less desirable now that I’m a parent (because I want to be spending that time with my son, frankly), but nonetheless it can be great feeling if you like and value your work. However, it can also be unhealthy and unsustainable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When colocated with other workers (i.e. in an office), there is rarely continuous flow. You get up, you stretch, you get coffee, you run an errand, you get pulled into a brainstorm, you chat with a colleague about their weekend, you play foosball, you get your ass handed to you because you grew up in Canada without a foosball table and why are all the European designers so absurdly good at this game and ugh whatever. The work day has its core of work, but this core is supported by the daily conversations, rituals, and inefficiencies that being human brings with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some folk use things like Pomodoro or “stand up” reminders to keep themselves on track. I occasionally use a countdown clock called a Time Timer if I need to do something that I desperately don’t want to do, but just needs to get done. It’s like a time prison. But mostly, I wouldn’t do that. Maybe set a reminder for yourself if you find you missed lunch once or twice. Make a point of getting up to get water, or treating yourself to lunch outside of the house. The point is to create rituals and habits, so that healthy breaks from your work are not only consistent but also so obvious as to be practically invisible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Be Aware of Dead Reckoning&lt;/h2&gt;

      /&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;
Things slip. It’s just how it goes. With every decision, and action, a little bit of error is introduced into the system. With each subsequent action, a little bit more error is introduced, and over time, these errors compound and you’re not where you  thought you were. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the essence of dead reckoning: a navigation technique that takes your previous position and estimates your current position based off of speed, travel time, etc. Except every position determined from dead reckoning is an estimate, not the truth. And so to reduce the error on that estimate, we need a way of identifying that “truth.” This cuts across the two big risks of remote work: 1) alignment with your team and stakeholders, and 2) actual delivery of value when outside of a co-located accountability structure. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we work outside of the co-located office, we lose the ease with which alignment can happen on a team working towards a common goal. This alignment certainly isn’t always correct, but it’s easier for the team mindset to take over. When working remotely, it’s easy to look at a low-bandwidth message on Slack or Microsoft Teams (which is terrible) and infer alignment from shared language used. But the mental model that you and your other conversant might hold can diverge pretty wildly, and lacking the added nuance of higher bandwidth modes of communication (like face-to-face, or as I like to call it, corona-close) the signal that you’re actually misaligned might not show up until it is too late. As a general rule, any time someone says “Great, we’re aligned on that” I take a minute to spell out exactly what it is that I’m doing next.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Be Kind To Yourself&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, be kind to yourself and others who are trying remote work for the first time. It’s not going to be for everyone. It might suck, it might be awesome, but it’ll absolutely be different. Give yourself space to fail the first month or two, and be open about what’s working and not working with your colleagues. Please extend the same generosity of spirit to them as well, and experiment with different tools, processes, and similar until you find something that sticks. With my current team, we’ve been through three different tools and several rounds of iteration before we hit something that really feels comfortable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, this need to work remotely is coming from an inherent fragility in our existing ways of working. Flatter organizations and open office environments can certainly lead to a stronger network effect and more co-creation within organizations, but it also gets you Gweneth Paltrow in Contagion (which I’m guessing was cross-marketing for Goop?).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I hope this helps. Don’t go too far down the productivity rabbit hole, but rather be reflective, be communicative, and be kind to yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This was my term paper for the first module in my Security Studies MA, written December 2019. Sharing here as a writing sample and because I enjoyed the process of writing it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The relationship between terrorism and failing states has an intuitive ring to it. As then-US Senator and later Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel argued in 2004, “Terrorism finds sanctuary in failed or failing states, in unresolved regional conflicts, and in the misery of endemic poverty and despair” (Hagel, 2004, p. 65). However, the true association is more suspect. The goal of this essay is to interrogate this relationship by deconstructing the value-driven language of terrorism and failing states, exploring the evidence that illuminates the complexity of the relationship, and considering what emerges from that complexity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While exploring examples primarily from Afghanistan and Somalia, as well as broader reaching empirical work, I conclude that the rhetorical relationship between terrorism and failing states is one of convenient adjacencies, rather than one intrinsic to the nature of failing states that causes terrorism to emerge. To the contrary, while failing states can serve as bases of operations for terrorist organizations, they also present considerable operational complexity engaged out of necessity, not desirability. The convenient rhetorical framing of failing states as a source of terrorism falls short of acknowledging this, instead activating value-laden and state-centric language to construct a state-level response to what is usually a sub- or non-state threat. Ultimately, the association between terrorism and failing states has emerged as a point of operational circumstance for the terrorists and a point of rhetorical convenience for their opponents, resulting in the failing state label exacerbating the existing dimensions of state failure. Finally, we will consider the opportunity cost in lives and capital by which this convenience is purchased, and how it might be spent differently or not at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Defining Terrorism&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to consider its relationship to failing states, terrorism must be deconstructed through the actions it engages in and upon what scope it operates. Terrorism is difficult to define, but is overwhelming framed by its application of violence to political ends (Duyvesteyn, 2004, p. 440) and often against civilian targets (Burke, 2008, p. 39). However, as Shanahan points out in his exploration of the definition of terrorism by states and academic sources, “no two are identical, and there are significant differences among them” (Shanahan, 2010, p. 176). By focusing too deeply on isolating a definition of terrorism as a generalized act, the term itself loses its value as an analytical unit rooted in the political context of its execution (Dexter, 2012, p. 124). In order to ground an analysis of the relationship between terrorism and failing states, then terrorism must be situated in a space, a time, and an actor-based context to hold relevance. Using this lens, the primary unit of comparative analysis I focus on is actors and organizations who conduct terrorist activities, instead of the abstract idea of terrorism itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Situating terrorism enables an exploration of the organizations and individuals responsible for terrorism within the context of failing states. Terrorist organizations engage in terrorist acts; they are organizations of individuals who conduct politically motivated violence often against civilian targets. Terrorist organizations are often “small organizations operating somewhat secretly without the power to take and hold territory” (Shapiro, 2013, p. 2), situating the definition in the covert and the asymmetric with regards to power. While there are many different types of terrorism (Jackson, 2011, p. 152), this framing permits a focus on international and domestic terrorism conducted by non-state and sub-state actors. Specifically, state terrorism is omitted in this consideration as outside of the scope of this analysis, although it does not to diminish the role that state terrorism holds in any broad definitional discussion on terrorism and its human impact (Jackson, 2011, pp. 183–195). In considering the connection between terrorism and failing states, state terrorism demonstrates how state-level actors wield the instruments of the state against its citizens and enemies domestically and internationally (Jackson, 2011, pp. 183–187). Observing a failing state engaging in state terrorism would present a different focus of analysis: that of state terrorism contributing or resulting from state failure versus separate coinciding phenomena executed by some entity other than the state or political elite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, the definition of terrorism in this analysis is necessarily one which is situated in time and space through its organizational structure, observable in that they have engaged in the act of terrorism and can be considered in historical and regional context, and distinct from the state and its institutions. One can contrast two maligned organization to exemplify the definition: before the US invasion, al-Qa’ida was considered a sub-state terrorist organization as it engaged in international terrorism and existed as separate but supported by the Taliban-controlled state of Afghanistan (National Commission on Terrorist Attacks upon the United States, 2004, pp. 50–52). Despite being a bureaucracy situated in Afghanistan (Byman, 2019, p. 68), al-Qa’ida remained organizationally distinct and often ideologically opposed to the Taliban (Byman, 2019, pp. 60–61). The Taliban is a state level actor that — while arguably engaging in state terrorism against its own population under its construction of Shari’a law (Hehir, 2007, p. 319) — held territory and otherwise wielded the apparats of state (National Commission on Terrorist Attacks upon the United States, 2004, pp. 63–67). The Taliban even engaged in (unhelpful) dialogue with the United States as a state-based power (National Commission on Terrorist Attacks upon the United States, 2004, pp. 110–111). By focusing on terrorism as situated in organizations and thereby an observable phenomenon, it becomes possible to explore how two separated concepts — terrorism as an observable phenomenon and failing states as a label to their cultural and political context — can co-construct a threat narrative to a given state’s national security interest so great as to justifying costly intervention (Hehir, 2007, pp. 310–311) and state reconstruction (Krasner and Pascual, 2005, pp. 153, 163). But having defined terrorism in these terms, what is this label of the failing state?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a Washington Post op-ed, then US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice wrote “The greatest threats to our security are defined more by the dynamics within weak and failing states than by the borders between strong and aggressive ones” (Rice, 2005). This statement reflected a feeling that was prevalent in the United States and its allies following the attacks of 2001 and had been percolating since the collapse of the Soviet Union: that while western liberal democracy was seen as ascendant, threats existed to the liberal democratic order that were best solved by the promotion of democracy abroad (Hehir, 2007, pp. 321–332; Verhoeven, 2009, pp. 407–408). Only a few months earlier, Secretary Rice’s teams proposed a new agency to engage in country reconstruction stating that “elements of state weakness constitute structural threats akin to dead leaves that accumulate in a forest. No one knows what spark will ignite them, or when. Over the long run, the only real way to create lasting peace is to promote better governance” (Krasner and Pascual, 2005, p. 155). In this view, failing states manifest insecurity through the complexity of potential emanating threats — refugees, drugs, disease, and most importantly in this discussion, terrorism­ — within their borders (Simons and Tucker, 2007, p. 387). By way of example, in the mid 2000s, over a decade of domestic conflict within Somalia had seen the rise of a burgeoning and popular Islamic governing coalition: the Council of Islamic Courts (CIC) (Menkhaus, 2007, pp. 364–365). In this case, certain members of that coalition – specifically al-Shebaab – were understood to be aligned with al-Qa’ida, but little evidence seemed to exist that they were a new franchisee of al-Qa’ida (Byman, 2019, pp. 159–160). Despite this, the association was leveraged to construct a now-familiar narrative that failing states breed terrorism: a frame that the Ethiopian military used to generate a rationale for intervention and recruit American support. The threat of terrorism to Ethiopia and America, and therefore the imperative to intervene in Somalia, were grounded in the probability ­— and not the certitude — of a threat (Verhoeven, 2009, pp. 416–417). This example suggests that failing states do not pose a deterministic threat (as a hostile nation with a standing army might), but rather represent a source of emergent and unpredictable insecurity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, any of these aforementioned threats can emerge from within otherwise economically stable, western nations. One need only consider the Irish Republican Army and its offshoots in the United Kingdom (Jackson, 2011, pp. 33, 131) as an obvious example. So if the security outcomes of failing states can manifest in non-failing states, what exactly is a failed, failing, fragile, or weak state in the first place? The Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA) has a helpful definition:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Though no universal definition of ‘fragile state’ exists, states are perceived as fragile when the government does not demonstrate the will and/or capacity to deliver on core state functions such as the enforcement of legitimate security and authority, the protection, promotion and implementation of human rights and gender equality, the rule of law, and even the most basic provision of services (e.g., in health and education, in enabling the private sector, and in environmental protection). When these core state functions are unreliable or inaccessible, the legitimacy of the state erodes and is likely to result in a breakdown in the social ‘pact’ of trust and cooperation within civil society and between civil society and the state.”(Keating, 2016, p. 12)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This definition presents two helpful insights. First, it hints at the idea of failed, failing, fragile, and weak states existing along a continuum: that perhaps rule of law might function, but gender equality might not. As Simons and Tucker point out, “entire regions don’t collapse; entire states never fail. Not everything falls apart, even when there is no government control” (Simons and Tucker, 2007, p. 391). With this in mind, I primarily frame state failure as situated upon a multidimensional continuum within the context of a given “failing” state relative to a western liberal ideal (Bøås and Jennings, 2005, p. 387).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second insight within the CIDA definition is that the “human security” paradigm undergirds this framing of failing states. Human security proposes a shift away from the state as the operational unit of analysis, instead focusing on the individual as the referent object in considering issues of development and security, as well as a more multidimensional framing of what constitutes a threat to the security and dignity of the individual (Bøås and Jennings, 2005, p. 389; McCormack, 2011, pp. 238–239). In the CIDA framing of fragile states, the legitimacy and stability of a state seems to break down as its capacity to engage in the economic, legal, and physical security of the individual degrades. But as McCormack points out, this breakdown of individual rights provides a path via the language of human security to frame failing states as threats to powerful states (McCormack, 2011, p. 244), thereby situating these weaker states as a risk in the national security discourse of relatively more powerful and nominally stable state actors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If failing states are measured along a continuum of adherence to the economic and physical security of the individual which itself is a measure of adherence to values espoused by a frame constructed by the institutions of a western liberal order (McCormack, 2011, pp. 243–244), then ultimately, the label of failing states is a normative construct describing state-based relationships and policy along the sliding scale of a western liberal value structure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Terrorism and Failing States&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having established that terrorism exists in the context of sub- or non-state organizations that engage in terrorist activity and that failing states are constructed in relation to international power dynamics, what are we to do with the assertion that failing states are emergent sources of terrorism (Piazza, 2006, p. 159; Newman, 2007, p. 463; Simons and Tucker, 2007, p. 387)? In the empirical discourse exploring this relationship, there seems to be only a loose association between failing states and terrorism (Piazza, 2006, pp. 172–174; Newman, 2007, pp. 483–484).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Significant amongst the conclusions is that while terrorist organizations and action can occur within the context of failing states, they can also — and in fact are more likely to — manifest in stable ones (Newman, 2007, p. 483). This observation supports the threat construction drive behind the application of failing state labels to a given national context, and serves to structure a potential counter-narrative to the emergence of terrorism in failing states: one that suggests that the risk and complexity presented by failing states can be as likely to undermine terrorist organizations as they are to support their endeavours which often rely upon access to infrastructure, communication, and resources (Hehir, 2007, p. 321). In contrast, state institutions in stable and/or democratic states may serve to benefit more clandestine or nascent terrorist organizations through access to welfare systems and the freedom to operate and recruit through the protection of free speech (Hehir, 2007, p. 320). In other words, failing states fail terrorists too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If terrorist organizations are as likely to emerge in more stable and wealthier nations, then why the connection between failing states and terrorism? Newman observes that while the actual level of terrorist activity is relatively low, the most destructive terrorist groups are located in failing states (Newman, 2007, p. 475,483). Al-Qa’ida has existed for decades as a terrorist organization in opposition to the Russians before it committed the most lethal terrorist attack the world has seen since the 1960s (Jackson, 2011, p. 135), but it was this singular and horrifying attack that transformed routine counter-terrorist activities (National Commission on Terrorist Attacks upon the United States, 2004, p. 115) into a global War on Terror (Jackson, 2011, p. 250). If acts of terror serve as a perverse form of political communication by terrorist organizations (Jackson, 2011, p. 116), states are also able to leverage their institutional and rhetorical powers to offset and combat this violent communication, such as by framing the fight against al-Qa’ida as part of a broader War on Terror (Jackson, 2011, pp. 62–63) or by labeling their supporters as failing states (Simons and Tucker, 2007, pp. 388–389). This not only serves to mobilize resources on the local level, but also to recruit other state and institutional actors to its on security needs (Buzan, 2006, pp. 1103–1104). The effect of this approach is tragically exemplified in the American failure to acknowledge the Somali Council of Islamic Courts as a legitimate state actor, and instead — as they had with the Taliban — situated them as first-and-foremost al-Qa’ida supporters (Menkhaus, 2007, pp. 377–378). This framing served as justification for an escalation and eventual invasion of Somalia by Ethiopian forces, a decision that threw a failing state rebuilding itself from within back into chaos (Verhoeven, 2009, pp. 416–417). So while Somalia is functionally the working model of the failing state (Verhoeven, 2009, p. 406), in this instance the label becomes self-fulfilling in the eyes of more powerful state actors and undermined the efforts of an otherwise potentially legitimate and effective local governing coalition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the case of Afghanistan, it appear as though the label of failing state was constructed not by its consideration relative to human security factors — though it certainly existed along that continuum (Hehir, 2007, pp. 318–319) — but by the terrorism of al-Qa’ida and the threat narrative constructed as a consequence of the 9/11 attacks. As Shapiro points out:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“What made Afghanistan so useful to al-Qa’ida from 1995 onward was not an absence of state institutions; it was that al-Qa’ida could operate under the protection of a sovereign state, relying on that state’s sovereignty to shield its infrastructure from potential attack by Western forces.” (Shapiro, 2013, p. 268)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When that sovereignty was undermined through the labeling of Afghanistan as a failing state — an action catalyzed by al-Qa’ida’s actions — the previous security and support that al-Qa’ida enjoyed (Hehir, 2007, pp. 318–319) was rapidly stripped away, and the organization was forced to adapt. Terrorist organizations are constantly managing their capacity to remain covert while still retaining a level of command-and-control over their operations, their ideology, and their resources (Shapiro, 2013, p. 8). Shapiro makes the argument that dramatic reductions in centralized control towards the more informal networked structure that has become a defining trait of al-Qa’ida is a response to an increasingly desperate security situation for the organization (Shapiro, 2013, p. 270). This suggests quite the opposite hypothesis to the dominant narrative about failing states and terrorism: that failing states present similarly complex operational or even existential challenges to terrorist organizations as they do to state actors. As Simons and Tucker point out, “terrorists also need a modicum of stability, they wouldn’t set themselves up in a collapsed state where they potentially become a bargaining chip between local factions” (Simons and Tucker, 2007, p. 398).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;If Not From Failing States&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If terrorist organizations are not a phenomenon emerging from failing states, then they must come from somewhere. World leaders can be said to acknowledge that the threat of terrorism is not bound to the traditional statist lens, as then-Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld did when he said “There may not be as many beachheads stormed as opportunities denied. Forget about ‘exit strategies’; we’re looking at a sustained engagement that carries no deadlines” (Rumsfeld, 2001). In this view, conflicts with terrorist organizations are multidimensional and complex: lacking a single situated location but rather lurking behind the “bankers’ pinstripes”, the “programmers’ grunge”, and certainly “desert camouflage” (Rumsfeld, 2001). Unfortunately, this statement may have proven prescient. The 9/11 hijackers came from diverse, generally privileged, and educated backgrounds across the Arab world (Friedman, 2017), empowering them to engage in a complex and covert terrorist act at an international scale. While stochastic events like the major international attacks of 9/11 belie reasonable prediction, the next big terrorist organization is likely to emerge from complexity: where population, diversity, and stressing factors like state repression converge (Piazza, 2006, p. 170).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, the conclusion I draw is that the terrorism of situated terrorist organizations can emerge anywhere, and that failing states are not significantly more likely to give rise to these groups and actions than stable states (Newman, 2007, pp. 483–484). Instead, if we acknowledge that failing states exist along a continuum of failing, then a potential way forward is to explore how specific populations at risk of radicalization might be failed by the state and its institutions, as “all states consistently fail some portions of their population” (Simons and Tucker, 2007, p. 400). This framing allows us to shift the language of failing states away from the unit of the state and its potential as a threat, and onto the specifics of how, where, and by what degree the state is failing the individual.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This shift away from the state-level of analysis points to effective ways in which the emergence of terrorist organizations can be stymied at the local level (Simons and Tucker, 2007, pp. 394–400). As Shapiro observes, terrorist organizations face a dilemma in which control and efficiency are in tension with security and covertness (Shapiro, 2013, p. 56). While the failure of state institutions can serve to shift their focus towards security as with al-Qa’ida after the retreat of the Taliban from state power, we should consider how else to put maximum pressure on terrorist organizations in order to undermine their ability to execute in a coherent and centralized fashion (Shapiro, 2013, p. 270). Simons and Tucker’s suggestion that engagement with local forms of governance and alliance outside of the norms articulated in the failing-versus-stable-state narrative (as constructed by the principles of human security) might be one path towards putting that pressure on terrorist organizations (Simons and Tucker, 2007, pp. 397–398). In the case of Afghanistan, they point out that: “Westerners seldom look at the world the way non-Western locals do, and thus seldom know where or how to look for what terrorists might be up to.” (Simons and Tucker, 2007, p. 396) By engaging critically with the dimensions through which a state (either ones own or another’s) fails some group or individual, then perhaps the voids and vacuums in which a terrorist threat might take root can be ferreted out.&lt;/p&gt;

The Bundy Ranch standoff and the question of domestic terrorism? Credit: Unknown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Terrorism does not emerge from failing states any more than it emerges from stable ones (Newman, 2007). Rather, terrorism emerges from terrorist organizations, which in turn emerge and are situated where diverse populations come into conflict (Piazza, 2006, p. 170). Similarly, failing states do not emerge from terrorism, though as we have seen in the case of Somalia (Menkhaus, 2007; Verhoeven, 2009) and Afghanistan (Hehir, 2007; Simons and Tucker, 2007; Shapiro, 2013), situated terrorism can serve to rationalize the failing state label when applied by powerful state and institutional actors like the United States (Bøås and Jennings, 2005, p. 387).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this analysis, it can be concluded that terrorism and failing states do not have a causal relationship, but rather a relativistic normative relationship can be constructed by elite, state, and institutional actors in order to functionally engage with the terrorist organization, the so-called failing state, or both (Hehir, 2007, p. 328). But if the label of failing state is one that can be constructed, then it can be dismantled as well. The label of failing states should not be a sentence carried by an entire state, but rather its constituent dimensions — with the many ways in which a state is failing or succeeding — should be considered in turn (Simons and Tucker, 2007, p. 400). When an understanding of terrorism is situated and performed by an organization forced to operate in the liminal spaces of state failure (Shapiro, 2013, pp. 265–269), the path to effectively combatting terrorist organizations lies not in constructing sweeping relationships between terrorism and failing states, but in forming relationships with local inhabitants to co-create stability and security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wrote a rudimentary python script to bulk import your Audible library to Goodreads. I’ll caveat with a statement: this is still pretty manual, but it automates the parts that are most time consuming. Overall, it shouldn’t take more than 5min to get your whole audible library into Goodreads. Then maybe just re-run the process every few months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://gist.github.com/readywater/b71c11428a151654474cdb673756319e&quot;&gt;You can view the script here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Get Your Audible Data&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It procedurally builds off of another script that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.themodernnomad.com/audible-statistics-extractor/&quot;&gt;exports your audible library&lt;/a&gt; , which is required to get it working. To run this script, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.audible.com/lib?purchaseDateFilter=all&amp;#x26;programFilter=all&amp;#x26;sortBy=PURCHASE_DATE.dsc&amp;#x26;pageSize=50&quot;&gt;visit your audible library&lt;/a&gt; and run the script on each page by hitting &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;command-option J&lt;/code&gt; to open your console (in Chrome and most other browsers), and run this script (which is just a minified version of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.static-18.themodernnomad.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Audible-ScreenScraperJanuary2019.txt&quot;&gt;one linked above&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://gist.githubusercontent.com/readywater/b71c11428a151654474cdb673756319e/raw/02f4e875aa1e55986c6e08a9dffd818bd7d92163/minified_audible_table_generator.js&quot;&gt;Link to script&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This will grab your library and turn the page into an html table. You can then easily select all on this table and paste it into google sheets or excel. Make sure to remove the repeated header data, but keep the top line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You need to do this &lt;strong&gt;for each page&lt;/strong&gt; of the library, so if you have 50+ books, simply go through each. Save the output; you can keep the file in an excel format or export to CSV.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Convert the Data into a Goodreads Format&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From here, you’ll want to run &lt;a href=&quot;https://gist.github.com/readywater/b71c11428a151654474cdb673756319e&quot;&gt;the python script&lt;/a&gt;. Save the file to whatever directly you’ve stored your audible spreadsheet and open your terminal. On Mac, do this by typing &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;command space&lt;/code&gt; and writing &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;terminal&lt;/code&gt; in the spotlight search.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;deckgo-highlight-code language=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
          &lt;code slot=&quot;code&quot;&gt;import pandas as pd
from isbntools.app import *

df = pd.read_excel(r&amp;#39;/path/to/the/saved/excel.xlsx&amp;#39;)

# Fetch ISBN from title and author using isbn tools
df[&amp;#39;isbn&amp;#39;] = df.apply(lambda x : isbn_from_words(x.Title + &amp;quot; &amp;quot; + x.Author), axis=1 )
# Convert Dates
df[&amp;quot;Buy Date&amp;quot;] = pd.to_datetime(df[&amp;quot;Buy Date&amp;quot;], format=&amp;quot;%m-%d-%y&amp;quot;, exact=False).dt.strftime(&amp;#39;%Y-%m-%d&amp;#39;)
#df[&amp;quot;Buy Date&amp;quot;] = df[&amp;quot;Buy Date&amp;quot;]
# Add to audible
df[&amp;quot;Bookshelves&amp;quot;] = &amp;quot;audible&amp;quot;
# Map the Date Read to the Buy Date as a loose proxy
df[&amp;quot;Date Read&amp;quot;] = df.apply(lambda x: x[&amp;quot;Buy Date&amp;quot;] if x[&amp;quot;Time Left&amp;quot;] &amp;lt; 30 else None, axis=1)
# This doesn&amp;#39;t actually register, but the export that Goodreads provides is Exclusive Shelf for the read status
df[&amp;quot;Exclusive Shelf&amp;quot;] = df.apply(lambda x: &amp;quot;read&amp;quot; if x[&amp;quot;Time Left&amp;quot;] &amp;lt; 30 else &amp;quot;currently-reading&amp;quot; if x[&amp;quot;Time Left&amp;quot;]/x[&amp;quot;Minutes&amp;quot;] &amp;lt; .8 else &amp;quot;to-read&amp;quot;, axis=1)
# So I fix it by just appending the status to Bookshelves depending on read status. i.e. if less than 30min left, it&amp;#39;s read. If you&amp;#39;ve listened to more than 20% of it, it&amp;#39;s Currently Reading
df[&amp;quot;Bookshelves&amp;quot;] = df.apply(lambda x: x[&amp;quot;Bookshelves&amp;quot;] + &amp;quot; &amp;quot; + &amp;quot;read&amp;quot; if x[&amp;quot;Time Left&amp;quot;] &amp;lt; 30 else x[&amp;quot;Bookshelves&amp;quot;] + &amp;quot; &amp;quot; + &amp;quot;currently-reading&amp;quot; if x[&amp;quot;Time Left&amp;quot;]/x[&amp;quot;Minutes&amp;quot;] &amp;lt; .8 else x[&amp;quot;Bookshelves&amp;quot;] + &amp;quot; &amp;quot; + &amp;quot;to-read&amp;quot;, axis=1)
# Rename Buy Date to Date Added
df.rename(columns={&amp;quot;Buy Date&amp;quot; : &amp;quot;Date Added&amp;quot;},inplace = True)

df.to_csv(r&amp;#39;/path/to/export/audible-goodreads-import.csv&amp;#39;)
print (&amp;quot;Done&amp;quot;)&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/deckgo-highlight-code&gt;
      
&lt;p&gt;Before running the script, you’ll want to change two things. Open then python script and change line 17: &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;df = pd.read_excel(r’/path/to/the/saved/excel.xlsx’)&lt;/code&gt; to the path to your file and line 35: &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;df.to_csv(r’/path/to/export/audible-goodreads-import.csv’)&lt;/code&gt; to your export CSV format.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then simply run &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;py audible-goodreads-import.py&lt;/code&gt; in terminal, and you should get a file output with the CSV.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From there, simply &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/review/import&quot;&gt;go to your goodread account’s import page&lt;/a&gt; and follow the import instructions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It will import and update current read status, ratings, correct ISBN, and add it to an “audible” bookshelf.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Next steps&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hopefully this serves to compliment other solutions out there, or as a starting point for someone who wants to put together a better solution for non-technical folk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you encounter bugs or improve the script somehow, please leave a comment below or in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://gist.github.com/readywater/b71c11428a151654474cdb673756319e&quot;&gt;GitHub gist&lt;/a&gt;. If this works out for folk, I might put together something a bit more automated and a bit more user friendly eventually, but for a quick script thrown together while watching &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.netflix.com/dk-en/title/81026300&quot;&gt;Next in Fashion&lt;/a&gt;, this works nicely.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[A More Intentional Wardrobe]]></title><description><![CDATA[I have an affinity for jackets and bags.

I have an affinity for jackets and bags. The two central functions to protect and to carry somehow stand out in my mind as being what this whole clothing endeavour is about. In the quest for a more perfect bag and a more perfect jacket, I’ve tried many form factors and materials. However, somewhere along the line this search evolved into more of a collection than a solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taking stock of this jackets collection, I realized that many hadn’t been worn in some time and the same could be said for the rest of my wardrobe. I have my most comfortable quotidian wears, but a lot of the clothing that had inspired me up to the point of acquisition wasn’t being used according to that aspiration or inspiration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further, despite my attempts at the Marie Kondo approach (which definitely works), I’d hit a point of diminishing return. I really like the clothes that I have, though I suffer a bit from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.telegraph.co.uk/men/fashion-and-style/11432284/Blokewear-the-clothes-men-love-that-women-hate.html&quot;&gt;Blokewear&lt;/a&gt; thing between Engineered Garments’s infinity pockets and Acronym nerdy functionality. They fit an acquired, developed, or aspired style most times; they were mostly of a quality that was worth preserving and repairing vs. replacing; and sometimes there was even an emotional connection or story tied to them. So another option was needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A More Perfect Closet&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The digital closet is a trope that I’ve seen quite a bit from the tangible interface/new media world, not to mention the genius that is &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/XNDubWJU0aU&quot;&gt;Clueless&lt;/a&gt;. What if computers could help us look good with what we have (though software business models being what they are, our wardrobes would likely balloon), and make the inferences and connections between different pieces of clothing for us. No need for colour coordinating, fit experiments, or quotidian creativity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/92f371cb4ab7338a6afabd67f16a8d6a/clueless.gif&quot; alt=&quot;Clueless Wardrobe&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Elsewhere in my life, I’d been using different tools that “automated” the creative and planning side of personal fitness. Strava and TrainingPeaks both have scaling training plans that tie into your phone and your Garmin, effectually offloading the responsibility to plan and personalize. But I’ve come to believe this was creating an intellectual weakness in how I approached maintaining the body. When a training plan ended, or if I got knocked off it somehow by work, a cold, or travel, the return to that curated path felt unnatural. Despite the exhaustive metrics surrounding me, I didn’t know how I got there, so I didn’t know how (or why) to continue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More recently, I’ve been using plans from the MT Institute, which just come as a weekly list of “Do this.” There’s no tracking or technical sophistication: their app is basically just a text document with a password with a few links to youtube videoes for how to do certain exercises. It was infuriating at first. But because of that friction, it has forced a planning and engagement with my fitness that I haven’t had in years. Somewhat naturally by extension, I started to learn the how and why of getting somewhere and keeping going.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This relates to my wardrobe because the fabric we wrap ourselves in serves to work a kind of daily muscle. In some ways, we are incredibly constrained. We have a limited wardrobe, filtered through biases and the influence of media and the social scenes that we came to age in, to address a specific set of needs around environmental (rain, temperature), cultural (formality and clique), and personal conditions (mood, aspiration, functional exigencies).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But in other ways, it is incredibly liberating. It presents a daily opportunity for creativity, exploration, and novelty with the things that we already own, that are being created seasonally, or that others have left behind in the case of vintage. With all the cultural weight that goes into forging a particular piece of clothing — anatomy, cultural context, history, material requirements, cost requirements, style, and similar — there’s the daily opportunity for something new to emerge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite having that opportunity (and me more than many with my absurd jacket collection), why wasn’t I working that muscle? I felt there might be a hint in the three things that these text-based training plans were giving me: productive friction, a need for planning, and additive practice. So I’m doing an experiment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Getting Organized&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve thankfully had a fair bit of experience working across different tools for project management. Everything from spreadsheets to Basecamp to Trello to Podio were potential options. I’d been aware of Notion for a while (mostly via a constant stream of Medium posts about either going to Notion and never looking back, or leaving notion and looking back in sadness), and from the ambient knowledge I had about it suggested that it might be a good option.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While my understanding of what Notion could do was pretty loose, the core of it seemed to be relational databases (data referencing other datas) with a handful of configurable views into that data: from table to spreadsheet to graph. Without thinking about it too hard, this felt like a good starting point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think about how you structure a wardrobe. You have lots of different types of clothing, all of which fulfill usually one or two functions. They have different properties to them: some are warm, others are waterproof, some are both. Some are made of leather, others of synthetic fabrics, still others of cotton. Some are blue, others gray, others black (at least in my case). So one can broadly generalize “clothing” as something with properties that serves to shield some part of your body. Of course, there are other things. Shoes, accessories, bags, etc. We’ll get to that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In general though, an outfit ends up being some combination of those pieces of clothing, plus some of the other things. That combination is most fundamentally constrained by the cultural and physical environment, and what you have available. Then you get the next level down: constraints emerging from ones own taste and context — where did you learn to dress yourself? And then you get additional constraints emerging from the combinations with contrast, clashing, and complementary mixes coming up across variables of colour, fit, material, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, no system that I put together in an afternoon is going to replace a sense of style and intuition, but maybe I could make something that productively augments what I already have. So I set out to accomplish a few things:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Creative&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To visualize or summarize how a set of things might look together without “going searching”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To surface clothes not being worn so as to wear more pieces more consistently in combinations I hadn’t tried before&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To save the combinations I knew worked, and track the ones that don’t&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Practical&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To be able to “schedule” what I was going to wear in advance (i.e. put things out for the next day as part of my other evening responsibilities)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To track frequency of wears across the different pieces of clothes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To track what I need to repair, tailor, or clean more effectively.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding Notion as I did, I believed that the relationships would loosely look like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Item (with properties)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Several Collections of Items (Aggregation of properties)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Schedule of Collections (Record of Use)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I set out to implement it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Using Notion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Clothing&lt;/strong&gt;
Using Notion to realize the initial vision was simple. At its most basic, Notion’s data manifests as a table or text. I started by creating a list of as much as I could from memory (mostly jackets and sweaters), and then filling that into the spreadsheet. From there, I started to fill out the properties (i.e. columns) that made sense. Name, photo, tags, size, colour. Then more subjective things, like fit and potentially style: things that I could search by. This first part set up, I went full Mari Kondo on my closet, getting everything out and photographing the lot against a white(ish) background.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was the project of an afternoon, quietly accomplished during my son’s naps and an hour my wife was able to buy me. After I got everything in the database (all clothes, shoes, and bags anyway), I started to explore setting them up as separate views and creating the relational structure that would define the “outfit” idea.&lt;/p&gt;

The outfit is where things didn’t quite work as I wanted. Structurally, it’s relatively simple — just a matter of creating relationships to the different Clothing items. This ends up looking something like this, with a few variables that help with filtering and a photo for reference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this case, I would frame this part as the “Productive Friction” component. Before I was just collecting data and constraints, now this is combining these pieces into a greater whole that (hopefully) works out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though this solution is “good enough” for now, I can’t wait for Notion to develop an API to query these objects and relationships directly, or to programatically establish filters. Basically, my ideal would be to create a collection of items with tags, and then have those items laid out in a gallery so I could see them visually. As it stands, there’s still a bit too much friction. Additionally, the actual selection of a relationship is a bit cumbersome with the naming scheme that I developed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The manual way to do this is to create a view for a table, and then filter according to relationships. Unfortunately, since those filters can’t be assigned to a variable, the whole thing has to be done manually (as far as I know). The ideal would be to pass in a series of properties to the view that could manipulate the filter, but here we are.&lt;/p&gt;

Finally, actually making a day-to-day decision is tied to seeing those combinations and those other external needs. In other words, the need for planning. Filtering by the relevant constraint is the key here, organizing by one axis and filtering by another. I can take a look at the options and what I need for the day and make decisions on the margins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Calendaring is usable but a bit inefficient. This is an example of the past few days to test out this whole idea. Unfortunately, Notion lacks integration with Google calendar, so the calendar view itself ends up being quite limited.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What was useful (again, an API would be better) was filtering calendars by day, and then adding the view inline as shown below. This allows a trivial dashboard to be created, though again, it’s not particularly useful without a way to dig into the relations. The other frustrating piece is that these views seem to “reset” depending on other navigation you do within the database.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion&lt;/strong&gt;
Notion is a pretty impressive tool. It’s a great way to create content and build up something data-driven pretty quickly. Ultimately, it got me a lot further than I expected, but if the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.notion.so/Does-Notion-have-an-API-I-can-use-4541b07a5caa46dba0026624646118c0&quot;&gt;Notion public API wasn’t already a critical part of their roadmap&lt;/a&gt;, I would probably be trying to figure out how to export all this work and build a small custom solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;End of the day, a custom solution would be better, but as a catch all tool for personal organization or project management (eg. You can see in the screenshot that I’m also using Notion to plan and track these posts), I’m pretty happy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Getting to Outcomes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Technical details of how I’m approaching this aside, does it actually work?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m not sure yet. I’ve worn colours and individual pieces over the past few days which I haven’t touched in months. One pair of shoes had to be dusted off (though thankfully I’d taken good care of them previously). So only a few days in, I do feel like it is having an impact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My hope is to follow this pattern for a little while. This is where the additive practice part comes into play. A decade ago, I followed blogs like the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thesartorialist.com/&quot;&gt;The Sartorialist&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.facehunter.org/&quot;&gt;FaceHunter&lt;/a&gt;, but never understood quite how someone got from where I was to where some of the repeat subjects on those blogs found themselves. Now, I don’t feel that same need, but I do want to use what I have for the greatest utility and the greatest fun. In this case, it means the goal is to reduce my sense of decision fatigue and increase the variability and interest in what I wear. So I’ll practice. I’ll follow this post up in a few weeks or months with the outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Technical Innovation in Asymmetric Conflict]]></title><description><![CDATA[Security and Innovation are described as going hand-in-hand.

&lt;p&gt;Security and Innovation are described as going hand-in-hand. The logic is pretty simple: existential threats spur on unconventional allocation of resources towards R&amp;#x26;D to outpace the enemy at the national level, and lack of resources and necessity drives improvisation and innovation on the ground.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But how does it actually happen? In today’s asymmetric conflicts, we’ve seen terrifyingly effective innovations in IEDs, remote controlled weapons platforms, and conventional arms in the form of home-modified pickup trucks, drones with grenades, AK47 turrets controlled with a playstation controller, or even rudimentary autonomous weapons platforms. All of these platforms are nominally being developed to balance the scales in asymmetric conflict, but the question of who, why, and how this work is being developed hasn’t yet been approached systematically&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Overall Question&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In general, I want to explore how technical innovation is developed within small, clandestine, violent organizations, primarily looking at insurgencies and terrorist organizations (with all the definitional complexity there).
Broadly then, these are some of the questions I want to ask:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Considering armed guerilla groups and terrorist organizations, are there observable models of technical innovation that occur across groups?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are there consistent ways that technical and management problem solving emerges across orgs like AQI, the IRA, ISIS, the FSA, etc?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is there something inherent to the structure of these groups that produce a particular type of innovation?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What commonalities, advantages, and/or disadvantages do these models have when compared with models of innovation within conventional state-based war-fighting organizations?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How might such models might be compared?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Who are the catalysts and maintainers of these innovation cycles, and does this frame on value and innovation change our understanding of who catalyzes what in these organizations?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What kinds of traits to these individuals share with other innovators in the private sector, academia, and government?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why this Topic?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was surprised by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/z4mmve/people-are-still-killing-each-other-with-diy-weapons-in-syria&quot;&gt;the remote gun platforms&lt;/a&gt; coming out of Syria and ISIS-occupied Mosul in Iraq. I come from a self-taught engineering and development background: building music and artwork with electronics and software that ultimately turned into a career in innovation and design. Those same skills that I learned in workshops or self-taught online are being applied in conflict zones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In subsequent exploration, some of the techniques for building and sharing these creations felt a bit too familiar and I’m curious to dig deeper. My intent is to explore how and if there are consistent and observable ways that these innovations are created, disseminated, and scaled within and between organizations. One tangible example might the SVBIED factories that ISIS managed, and the way that &lt;a href=&quot;https://international-review.org/an-analysis-of-islamic-states-svbied-use-in-raqqa/&quot;&gt;the platforms evolved across the conflict and between cells&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason for approaching this as a masters thesis is two fold. First, it will hopefully let me leverage my professional experience to bring a different lens to the work, and do so in collaboration with my advisors. Second, I’m hoping to take two approaches to this: an empirical and a critical approach. I’ll talk about that later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why Me?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite a political science degree, I’ve worked for a decade in startups and innovation consulting. Working within both small and large organizations, I’ve tried to surface the interesting loops within human systems and to apply learning from systems thinking in what I build (eg. Donna Meadows, John Boyd, and more contemporary design thinking work). In this case, I want to do this research based off of the artifacts of the organizations instead of directly observing it as a consultant, employee, or ethnographer might. More broadly, I want to explore whether there is a certain inevitability in the innovation capacity of a business relative to its structure, and whether the same can be said the organizations I propose to study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Research Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope to leverage databases like &lt;a href=&quot;https://ctc.usma.edu/harmony-program/&quot;&gt;Westpoint’s Harmony DB&lt;/a&gt; (captured and translated management literature from terror orgs, especially AQI) and mimic some of the methodologies that Jacob Shapiro describes in &lt;a href=&quot;https://press.princeton.edu/books/hardcover/9780691157214/the-terrorists-dilemma&quot;&gt;The Terrorist’s Dilemma&lt;/a&gt;. I also find work by Erica Chenoweth to be incredibly inspiring, and have been closely reading her approaches. I plan on leveraging as much social media content from YouTube, twitter, reddit, etc. as possible to try and understand timelines of “innovation” moving across groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a starting point, I’m initially taking a look at an unclassified US Army report on remote and tele-operated weapons, the substantial reporting around these DIY weapons in Syria and Iraq, and forums like Reddit’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/shittytechnicals&quot;&gt;/r/ShittyTechnicals/&lt;/a&gt; (though I don’t know if Technicals count in this case). In addition, arms researchers like CalibreObscura and other OSINT-like researchers have used methodologies that might be borrowed and learned from. It is unlikely that I will do interviews with current/former combatants for a variety of reasons, both ethical and practical.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Critical Lens&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doing this research in the international security studies context and still following the post-structural framing we’ve been introduced to so far is a point of some anxiety. I’m committed to take as empirical an approach as I can to this work, but I think the analysis of bureaucratic data might highlight interesting details on the “who” involved in these innovations.
This raises some interesting questions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How do these innovations shift power relationships and who serves to drive those innovations forward?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Where are the inventors and makers coming from?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What kind of power do these makers hold within these organizations relative to others?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Wrapping Up&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All this said, I’m excited to do this work. While many are still living the conflicts that birthed these deadly creations, the past decades of multi-party asymmetric conflict have left a trove of media and data to be considered in understanding just how technical and management innovation emerge in organizations to weak to engage in conventional warfare. My hope is this work can serve to make some small contribution in highlighting mechanisms to interdict the worst of these innovations, especially those used in the targeting of non-combatants.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Reflecting on 2019]]></title><description><![CDATA[2019 has been a weird combination of my most exhausting, fulfilling, chaotic, and structured year to date.

&lt;p&gt;2019 has been a weird combination of my most exhausting, fulfilling, chaotic, and structured year to date. Midway through 2018, I decided that I wouldn’t share anything until it was “done”, or at least passed a significant milestone. So while I usually don’t write posts like this, this year felt worth the reflection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Four Changes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Four big life changes happened this year, mostly set up in 2018.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, and most importantly, my son Emil joined us. Writing this, he’s eight months and two weeks old. He’s trying to figure out how to stand, can put himself to sleep, and the teeth are attempting to come through.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, I created &lt;a href=&quot;https://knowsi.com&quot;&gt;Knowsi&lt;/a&gt;, a small SaaS business to manage informed consent in research. You can sign up for a free account if you use consent forms in your work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Third, I started a (part-time) graduate program in International Security Studies at the University of Leicester. This is mostly inspired by my experience at the New America fellowship and at the Pentagon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fourth, I survived the fall, where all three of these came together with my consulting practice. Initially that survival was mostly a function of an unequal workload between myself and my wife, so not exactly sustainable or fair.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Baby – Emil&lt;/h2&gt;

      /&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the summer of 2018, I was back in the US for a few weeks and had just walked out of my NREMT exam when I called Ayla to tell her I’d passed. On the topic of positive test results, she shared that she was pregnant and everything started to shift. The remainder of that year became one of preparing for something neither of us really understood: in our bodies; our identities; our relationship to work, to the world, to each other, and to the son we hadn’t yet met.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Emil showed up on April 10th, 2019 at our home in Frederiksberg. For all the classes and reading and discussions of the previous months, I wasn’t even close to prepared. Since he’s arrived, every week has been different and every week forces something new learned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With some planning and savings, I was able to take three plus months of paternity leave. In this whirlwind of diapers and family visits, I learned a bit about how caring for Emil manifested as action: changing a diaper, giving him a bath, checking if he’s warm enough, making sure he’s fed (the first few times the confused look he gave me was incredible), rewatching the baby heimlich on YouTube for the 12th time. Cumulatively these little acts have started to paint a picture of fatherhood for me that I want to build upon — parenthood as a craft. Any craft requires practice and introspection and that’s been (more than anything else) the past eight and a half months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, I think this means taking the quotidian parts of parenthood incredibly seriously. Little actions done frequently build up over time, and so those little actions will contribute to who he becomes. But as important are the intuitions acquired after doing something many, many times, and using those intuitions to deal with the unknown and the unpredictable. We’ll see how this theory of parenthood changes, but at least for now this is the model I’m working with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Product – Knowsi&lt;/h2&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://knowsi.com&quot;&gt;Knowsi&lt;/a&gt; emerged from a conviction that consulting as I had been doing likely wasn’t the right path forward. Coming off of an extended consulting project that had seen me back-and-forth from the UK and fairly burnt out, I had been collecting and exploring different ideas (and savings) for a small, bootstrappable Software-as-a-Service business. My theory: knowing that Emil was on his way, I wanted to have something that could bring in income and support a working lifestyle that would let me be present.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I settled on Knowsi from a host of other ideas while flying into Paris for New Years 2019. Consent management had always been a challenge in user research, with lost forms and disempowered participants. As a user researcher myself, I knew the problem well and had seen when it goes wrong. It was a discrete need, something that I was solving for myself, and was feasible with my skillset as an indie developer and designer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spent the next few months getting it off the ground, piloting it with the the Copenhagen Institute of Interaction Design, and rapidly turning it into something that worked, could be used, etc. When Emil was born, I took a few months off, and my diaper changing speed improved considerably . Unfortunately, Knowsi didn’t progress much in that time, but I got my first customer and it was a huge boost in morale. In the fall, Ayla and I did a complete redesign of the site and relaunched it, and from there have figured out a good pattern of collecting feedback (and responding quickly to bugs), setting priorities, and aggressively pushing on particular features through time-bound sprints.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than anything else though, I found that working on a business (vs a product) solo is maybe more trouble than its worth. While I can do most of the product work and some of the business, the constant focus switching is to to the detriment of the actual work. Also my marketing skills are useless. So in the new year, I intend to re-focus on Knowsi and seek collaboration and help from friends, colleagues, or people who share a similar excitement for qualitative research and privacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, I also just launched free subscription tier to support students and solo researchers in gathering and maintaining consent with their research participants. So if you’ve been curious about what I’ve been working on but didn’t want to put in a credit card, &lt;a href=&quot;https://knowsi.com/join&quot;&gt;now you can use Knowsi for free&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This has been a long time coming. I’ve flirted with graduate school for years. In 2012, I’d been accepted to NYU’s ITP program and almost moved to New York. However, after months of soul searching, I ended up saying no because didn’t want to be in that kind of debt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since then, I’ve had a lot of fun: starting two businesses, working at IDEO, at the Pentagon, being a think tank fellow, and currently living a slightly charmed independent consulting/product person’s life in Denmark. But every single year I start musing about returning to school, though that idea of what I would return FOR has shifted over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coming out of my Public Interest Tech fellowship with New America last year, I had started to explore working more deeply in issues surrounding the refugee crisis, climate change, and a more systemic view of security. Technology skills are great and useful, but I believe that to really be effective (and not harmful), I needed to shore up my knowledge of the issues and the critical discourse. So after many conversations, explorations, and books read, I landed on Security Studies as a field.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite my career in code and design, my academic roots are in political science, so I had (rusty) familiarity with the topic. I ended up reaching out to my former professor, Renan Levine. I actually hadn’t had particularly good grades in Professor Levine’s classes, but I reached out to him because he had a massive impact on my transition into design. Specifically, he taught me how to visualize my thinking, how to approach it systematically, and how to use externalized ideation as a lever for creativity. Weirdly, I believe what I learned in his research, policy, and statistics classes became my entryway into interaction design and entrepreneurship. And despite nearly a decade between his classes and my application, he wrote my recommendation letters that helped me get into a security studies MA in the UK. (So thank you Renan and Matt Cutts for the letters of recommendation!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I’ve just wrapped up the first term and starting to think about my dissertation. I have difficulty expressing how excited I am for the whole enterprise. Life would be a lot easier without this as I have to be incredibly structured in my time: I’m often up till two or three in the morning, and it has meant getting creative with the day-to-day of the household (which I’ll talk about next). But even a few months in I feel like what I’m learning is surfacing new areas to explore and a new way for me to understand the issues that I care about, but have struggled to act on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Problems — Survival&lt;/h2&gt;

      /&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, survival. This year has had a lot to do with privilege. My wife and I have benefited from the Danish child care policies. I had access to personal capital, skills, and time to start a small business. I had a network and the time to apply for a university. I had the network and skills to be selective in what I do work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite this, the past year has been the busiest in my life. Keeping up with friends and social engagements has been a struggle. Beyond even the normal limits to sleep that new parents face, to get everything done I’ve had an unhealthy number of nights with just four to six hours of sleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dealing with multiple responsibilities: Emil, working with Knowsi customers, consulting as a product manager with IKEA, leading design mentorship with the Innofounder accelerator program, and finally, acclimating to my grad program. When all of those came together in September, I managed to burn out in a few weeks and things weren’t working. I didn’t see failure as an option though, and I was able to figure out some new techniques for time management and tracking everything. It involved late nights, but nothing really slipped — or at least that’s what I initially thought.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this initial “balance”, I unfairly relied on my wife to pick up slack that I wasn’t seeing or was dramatically de-prioritizing. &lt;a href=&quot;https://slate.com/human-interest/2018/03/women-are-overburdened-with-their-families-mental-loads.html&quot;&gt;A weakness in our household dynamic that had existed previously at a lower level&lt;/a&gt; was suddenly becoming exacerbated by these new stressors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since that first month of chaos, we’ve been working together to figure out how to balance that better. Ayla and I have always used our skills as designers and managers to do the work of creating a good relationship and life together. So figuring out “okay, what does it mean to be equal NOW?” became a question that we were at least equipped to ask and start to figure out together. One tangible example worth mentioning is this (flawed but useful as a starting point) method in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/44071899-fair-play&quot;&gt;Fair Play&lt;/a&gt; book. As a way of visualizing the unseen tasks (an issue for me), it’s been effective. Given the speed at which Emil’s needs change, we have a standing meeting every week to figure out how our needs are changing alongside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, a willingness to share, visualize, and design the hard conversations by way of whiteboard, post-it, and through artifact goes a long way. If you’ve got a background in service design and facilitation, turning those skills on yourself and your relationships is incredibly worthwhile (albeit painful sometimes). If we hadn’t had these skills to begin with, I suspect we wouldn’t have been able to surface the need to have these conversations as quickly as we did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What Didn’t Work&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a few things this year that didn’t quite work out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As a &lt;strong&gt;consultant&lt;/strong&gt;, I (purposefully) brought in a lot less revenue than I normally do. I’m fortunate to be able to even make the decision to work less and make less, but still, it was a dip from previous years and I felt a fair bit of emotional stress even with it being intentional.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As a &lt;strong&gt;startup design mentor&lt;/strong&gt;, I dropped the ball this autumn. Despite successful workshops facilitated and some great reviews from my teams, I wasn’t nearly as present or available as I had been previously. Unfortunately, I’ve decided that this is the piece won’t get any better down the road, so I’ve decided to step back from leading the Design Mentorship at the Innofounder program.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As a &lt;strong&gt;friend&lt;/strong&gt;, I was never around. Part of this is a function of adult life for anyone, but I was conspicuously absent from group chats, drinks, parties, and general hangouts. Even when friends came to visit, I often had to truncate my time to work on an essay or deal with work. I haven’t figured out how to be better at this yet.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As an &lt;strong&gt;indie dev/founder/whatever&lt;/strong&gt;, I got distracted chasing shiny things a few times. For example, instead of focusing on Knowsi, I spent a few weeks building an MVP of a product called &lt;a href=&quot;https://fitfaj.com&quot;&gt;FitFaj&lt;/a&gt;, a customized training plan for expectant fathers. There are a few people using it actually, but I really should not have done this.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I started &lt;strong&gt;studying Arabic&lt;/strong&gt; in the Spring of 2019 after almost six months of trying to get into an Arabic language school in Copenhagen. I’d initially been studying Danish, and abandoned it when the state-supported language centres were defunded. I’ve also been studying pretty consistently with a tutor from &lt;a href=&quot;https://natakallam.com/&quot;&gt;Natakallam&lt;/a&gt;. However, I honestly don’t feel like I’ve gotten that far, and having just finished my most recent textbook, I’m struggling to figure out what the next step is. Regardless, the language itself is immensely interesting, and being able to read the script and understand some basics has me excited to figure out how to continue.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Things that Did Work&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nutrition&lt;/strong&gt; was a bit of the bass rhythm for this year. I think I would have struggled without it. I started following a keto diet in 2018, and am doing a keto-like thing with just low carbs (no one should be denied lentils and bananas). In general, the keto diet was ridiculous and I wouldn’t recommend it. It worked well for me, with the greatest payoff being consistent energy and no spikes of fatigue mid-day. On the negative, it meant my eating habits were incredibly inflexible, and if I didn’t get the right vitamin and electrolyte mix, I’d feel like I was dying. However, it set up a framework for me to do a less restrictive but still low carb diet incredibly easily, so it was an effective habit maker.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fitness&lt;/strong&gt; has been a bigger piece: I’ve been following a series of plans by the &lt;a href=&quot;https://mtntactical.com/&quot;&gt;Mountain Tactical Institute&lt;/a&gt; folk, and have really enjoyed them. I also got certified as a personal trainer (I use certifications to learn about things like this, also because of the FitFaj diversion). I don’t really follow my own plans (though have been making plans for others), but it has really helped make sense of the why and how of others’ plans, specifially the MTI ones. That knowledge has also motivated me to exercise with a consistency that I’ve never been able to keep before, about 6x a week.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Zeroing out my &lt;strong&gt;email&lt;/strong&gt; inbox is a obnoxious and terrible, but it’s been a primary technique for keeping on top of what’s coming in. Combined with a obsessive todo list keeping (I use Things3, but anything works, including paper), it has permitted an offloading and addressing of things in bite-sized chunks, and opened up more space for actually doing work. It’s far from perfect, but for whatever reason having unaddressed emails and tasks like that creates either avoidance or stress.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Acknowledging &lt;strong&gt;cycles&lt;/strong&gt;. This one was and is hard. I can work intensely and well in cycles, and then need to reset. This manifests as days of working quite passionately like a maniac, then needing a day or three of not doing really anything. When I fall out of these productive cycles, it manifests as my sleep schedule being out of whack, one of my core habits (like the inbox thing, or fitness) slipping, or feeling kind of anxious. This year, I feel like I finally got a handle on these cycles in a way that has made me a lot more effective.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Remote Work&lt;/strong&gt;. I cannot express how effective working remotely or semi-remotely is. I can be present with Emil, instead of commuting I can go to the gym, I get a massive amount more done, and the socializing and networking part of working becomes something that is more designed and less imposed. It requires noise canceling headphones and clear boundaries, but those headphones can be removed if you’re needed. It also requires a set of tools and technologies that really have to be tailored to each situation, and developed in collaboration with your team. Anyway, I hope to mostly work in remote or semi-remote context going forward, both to be around for Emil more, but also simply to get more done.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Going into 2020&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what does 2020 look like? Honestly, I don’t know yet, and to the point of my “don’t share until there’s a milestone” thing, I’ll share when it’s time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In general, Emil is starting at daycare in the new year,so I’m going to modify my &lt;a href=&quot;http://shop.larryvsharry.com/&quot;&gt;Bullitt bike&lt;/a&gt; for daily dropoff and figure out my sleep schedule. I’m continuing to work on Knowsi, and want to explore ways to put more time into it and my customers. I’m continuing to consult with IKEA, and work with a burgeoning team there that honestly, I can’t wait to share more about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beyond that though, we’ll see. In a week, this post itself went from “I need to write a reflection” to “I want to share that reflection” to “I need to make that blog finally” to “maybe I should just redo my site as a blog.” So… here we are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m going to be writing and posting more this year, plus there’s a maybe project with a friend from Toronto if you’re interested in international relations, politics, and design. So if you’re able, please subscribe to the update newsletter below!&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
