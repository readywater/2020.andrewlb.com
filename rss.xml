&lt;p&gt;Shortly before the world descended into a pandemic, I had an idea for something I wanted to write. Last year, my friends Zahra, Marc, and I had been batting around the idea for a podcast (as one does) about design, strategy, and politics from a Canadian lens, but we were never able to coordinate between ourselves to get it together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the past few months, I’d been taking out some advertising with a newsletter called &lt;a href=&quot;https://densediscovery.com&quot;&gt;Dense Discovery&lt;/a&gt;, which had been started by designer and editor Kai Brach. It was thoughtfully arranged, had a good pace, was opinionated, and helped me discover some things that didn’t normally have time to deal with. So using that structure as a template, I wrote my first newsletter as a prototype — a simple structure in markdown.

    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love Markdown. It has its faults, but I find it faster and more intuitive than any word processor. I’m writing this in markdown using Bear right now, and will be uploading it as a markdown file to be compiled by Gatsby, after all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I took the same approach with Diverge. Early in the year on &lt;a href=&quot;https://andrewlb.com&quot;&gt;andrewlb.com&lt;/a&gt;, I had upgrade my site from a simple Jekyll site to a gatsbyjs page, following their general tutorial for creating a blog and throwing in some modifications in the process. The workflow made a lot of sense to me, especially the part about Gatsby generating a static site and hosting it on GitHub pages. And since newsletters are just HTML, I figured the same workflow might apply there. It shouldn’t take a whole lot to take the same principle and apply it to a newsletter, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;DIYing a Newsletter Platform&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Turns out it was more complicated than I thought. To begin with, I was starting with an advantage. As part of the privacy-first principle with &lt;a href=&quot;https://knowsi.com&quot;&gt;Knowsi&lt;/a&gt; (and a desire to reduce dependencies on 3rd party services, I self-host a newsletter system called &lt;a href=&quot;https://sendy.co&quot;&gt;Sendy&lt;/a&gt;. Sendy is a PHP application that lets you manage newsletters. It does it pretty simply, though it certainly isn’t as full featured as something like Mailchimp. It has all the annoying bits of running your own infrastructure (eg. Keeping it updated), but I’ve enjoyed this approach.

      /&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I had that part in place. But what about actually making the newsletter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, upon deeper inspection, turns out newsletter HTML in a “cross-browser” sense is even more of a nightmare than getting browser-based compliance. I did some digging around, and again found Kai’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@kaibrach/creating-a-fully-customised-weekly-newsletter-b7c31d580b4e&quot;&gt;look behind Dense Discovery&lt;/a&gt; to be helpful here in deciding on what path to take. But I ended up taking the slightly harder one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started by forking andrewlb.com, and starting from that as a baseline. I was familiar with the codebase, so it let me get started pretty quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I knew that I wanted a few things:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Everything must be component based&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Everything should be responsive&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I should write the newsletter only once&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, overall a few decisions were easy to make.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since it’s Gatsby, using react components for layout was an obvious choice. That addressed the component based structure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because I was writing in Markdown, I could leverage Remark and the static rendering of that markdown onto the page. This also meant I could explore different Remark and Gatsby plugins to facilitate rendering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because I was using Gatsby, I figured I could override part of its rendering lifecycle and simply compile the same “page” is a few different ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And finally on the responsive front, I thought this would be easy, but as Kai’s article pointed out, turns out email HTML is a bit harder than I initially realized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So let’s take each of these in turn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Make it Component Based&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve been using React for a while now, so know it pretty well. The JSX and component based structure, as well as the r eact component lifecycle in a server-side rendering context is pretty familiar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am also a &lt;em&gt;huge&lt;/em&gt; fan of styled components, though readily acknowledge the arguments against them. So a lot of decisions were less decisions and more defaults.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it came to structuring the components though, it was a bit less clear. I initially thought I’d use MJML, for example. ’ve used MJML before to write the Knowsi newsletter, and have a template that kind of works for that. I had an idea that perhaps I could lay out react components using MJML syntax. But it turned out to be a bit more complicated than it was really worth. The MJML syntax described on the component level ended up being a bit of nightmare when it came to rendering the page out, and so I pretty quickly abandoned that approach in favor of simply laying out components using HTML tables.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were also numerous components that I had to over-ride in the Gatsby process, including the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;html.js&lt;/code&gt; one. Normally this is managed pretty simply, but html emails require a handful of headers that help with renderin. &lt;a href=&quot;https://webdesign.tutsplus.com/articles/build-an-html-email-template-from-scratch--webdesign-12770&quot;&gt;This was a helpful reference&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, I had to figure out how to get the components to render the markdown appropriately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This came from me kind of misunderstanding how Remark worked, to be perfectly honest. That misunderstanding resolved itself pretty quickly after I dug into it though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I initially ended up using a plugin called &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;gatsby-remark-custom-blocks&lt;/code&gt;, which took blocks of text like this:&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;deckgo-highlight-code &gt;
          &lt;code slot=&quot;code&quot;&gt;[[region | Europe]]
|[World War II and the battle over collective memory in Eastern Europe](https://www.dw.com/en/world-war-ii-and-the-battle-over-collective-memory-in-eastern-europe/a-53356626)
|On the topic of lenses, I found this article to be pretty interesting. Putin is a leader with a strong sense of national history, and his resonance towards World War II as a moment of national pride and unbelievable trauma for Russians makes for an interesting analysis.&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/deckgo-highlight-code&gt;
      
&lt;p&gt;And wrapped those in a stylable div. I still use them in the region section, to look like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span
      class=&quot;gatsby-resp-image-wrapper&quot;

        loading=&quot;lazy&quot;
      /&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This wasn’t really helpful for most of the things I wanted to lay out though, and it didn’t let my apply react component-level styling to those elements. Really, I was hoping to pass the markdown content into those components as props, and have it render appropriately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The solution ended up being to use a tool called &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rehypejs/rehype&quot;&gt;Rehype&lt;/a&gt;. I simply wrote the different components with their appropriate props, and added this code to the post structure.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;deckgo-highlight-code language=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;
          &lt;code slot=&quot;code&quot;&gt;import rehypeReact from &amp;quot;rehype-react&amp;quot;

const renderAst = new rehypeReact({
  createElement: React.createElement,
  components: {
    // These are some of the components I&amp;#39;m using
    region: Region,
    sponsor: FeatureAd,
    security: Security,
    voices: Voices,
    reading: Reading,
    main: Main,
    twitter: Twitter,
    imageblock: ImageBlock,
    classified: Classified,
    jobs: Jobs,
  },
}).Compiler&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/deckgo-highlight-code&gt;
      
&lt;p&gt;Then, where the markdown data is transformed by Remark, I added&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;deckgo-highlight-code &gt;
          &lt;code slot=&quot;code&quot;&gt;{renderAst(post.htmlAst)}&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/deckgo-highlight-code&gt;
      
&lt;p&gt;And made sure that the graphql interface was returning the appropriate field:&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;deckgo-highlight-code language=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;
          &lt;code slot=&quot;code&quot;&gt;markdownRemark(fields: { slug: { eq: $slug } }) {
      id
      excerpt(pruneLength: 160)
      htmlAst
      fields {
        slug
      ...
      }

&lt;p&gt;This allowed me to structure the layout of the site as react components and simply pass in key values as props. &lt;a href=&quot;https://divergeweekly.com/issue/10/&quot;&gt;An example from issue #10&lt;/a&gt; is the component housing the main block.&lt;/p&gt;

  ![Kunrong Chen, Daily exercise, 2014](img/SFS2-EF.jpg) Hi. First, I want to
  share a point of gratitude. My small business, [Knowsi](https://knowsi.com),
  was awarded the [Sage Ocean Concept
  Grant](https://ocean.sagepub.com/blog/tools-and-tech/concept-grant-winner-knowsi-interview)
  this week by Sage Publishing. ... As always, [please subscribe to and share
  Diverge Weekly](https://divergeweekly.com) if you haven’t and [send me a
  note](mailto:alb@andrewlb.com) if you have questions or feedback!
&amp;lt;/main&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/deckgo-highlight-code&gt;
      
&lt;p&gt;This has some weird bits, but it’s working pretty well so far provided I want to stick with markdown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In terms of general workflow then, I usually write the main article in Bear, export to markdown into the Gatsby content folder, and do a quick copy-paste to this template I’ve created:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then simply double check that things look right on development, turn &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;published&lt;/code&gt; to true, and deploy to &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;gh-pages&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Everything Should Be Responsive&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This turned into a massive pain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The initial site came together in about 3 days of pretty frantic work in February.

        loading=&quot;lazy&quot;
      /&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it didn’t really look that great. I was borrowing the initial layout from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.densediscovery.com/&quot;&gt;Dense Discovery&lt;/a&gt;, and hadn’t really figured out the Rehype part yet. So I was trying to lay things out primarily with CSS, and mostly just get something up to see if it worked. I default (to a fault) towards spin up prototypes, put in front of people, see what happens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s not much I can say here that hasn’t already been written by more knowledgeable folk. I would suggest checking this out as a starting point for html emails:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2017/01/introduction-building-sending-html-email-for-web-developers/&quot;&gt;An Introduction To Building And Sending HTML Email For Web Developers — Smashing Magazine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And for the blog itself, make sure to test that SEO and open graph data is being hydrated properly:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://socialsharepreview.com/&quot;&gt;Social Share Preview – Check social media link previews&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’d actually messed something up in the way that remark was rendering things, and as a consequence the first month of the newsletter didn’t render properly. After I changed that, I started getting a lot more clicks and folk contacting me about my writing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Write it Once&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, I just wanted to write this once, so that the Gatsby page itself should render at the same time as the mail page, and everything should be easy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tried a bunchhhh of different things, and ultimately resolved on just taking the rendered HTML as it was, and transforming THAT into the mail html. The ideal would be that I’d render two different, properly formatted versions, but I couldn’t quite figure out where to do those modifications, so this became the easy point of intervention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s the code:&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;deckgo-highlight-code language=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;
          &lt;code slot=&quot;code&quot;&gt;exports.onPostBuild = async () =&amp;gt; {
  console.log(
    “Build Complete for Post Build”,
    path.resolve(__dirname, “public/mail/“)
  )

  const pattern = “public/mail_*/**/*.html”
  const files = await globAsync(pattern, { nodir: true })

  const inlined = files.map(async file =&amp;gt; {
    const data = await readFileAsync(file, “utf8”)&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/deckgo-highlight-code&gt;
      
&lt;p&gt;First, I grab all the files in the mail folder which were rendered with CreatePage, and loop through them.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;deckgo-highlight-code language=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;
          &lt;code slot=&quot;code&quot;&gt;    return new Promise(async (resolve, reject) =&amp;gt; {
      let html = String(data)
      const url = “https://divergeweekly.com”

      const $ = cheerio.load(html)

      $(“script”).remove() // remove scripts
      $(“noscript”).remove() // remove scripts
      $(“link”).remove() // remove links&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/deckgo-highlight-code&gt;
      
&lt;p&gt;Then I remove the tags that aren’t going to be used. Links, script, and noscript. I never use jquery anymore, but for whatever reason it was a helpful default here, so I ended up relying on Cheerio just for simplicity sake.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;deckgo-highlight-code language=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;
          &lt;code slot=&quot;code&quot;&gt;      $(“img[src^=‘/‘]”).prop(“href”, function(_idx, oldHref) {
        if (!oldHref) {
          console.log(“Something is weird”, oldHref, _idx)
        } else {
          return oldHref.append(url)
        }
      })

      // Convert Gatsby image to image
      $(“.gatsby-resp-image-wrapper”).each(function() {
        const _this = this

        $(this).replaceWith(
          `&amp;lt;img src=“${url +
            $(this)
              .find(“img”)
              .attr(“src”)}” alt=“${$(this)
            .find(“img”)
            .attr(“alt”)}” /&amp;gt;`
        )
      })

      // Convert picture
      $(“picture”).each(function() {
        const _this = this

        $(this).replaceWith(
          `&amp;lt;img src=“${url +
            $(this)
              .find(“img”)
              .attr(“src”)}” alt=“${$(this)
            .find(“img”)
            .attr(“alt”)}” /&amp;gt;`
        )
      })&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/deckgo-highlight-code&gt;
      
&lt;p&gt;I think went through and converted all the images to absolute links and removed the Gatsby responsive images. I wasn’t able to figure out how NOT to use Gatsby images while still leveraging the Sharp plugin for optimizing the image rendering, so this became my shortcut. It’s not the cleanest, but it works pretty well.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;deckgo-highlight-code language=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;
          &lt;code slot=&quot;code&quot;&gt;      // Convert all links
      $(“a”)
        .not(‘[href^=“http”],[href^=“https”],[href^=“mailto:”],[href^=“#&amp;quot;]&amp;#39;)’.each(function() {
          $(this).attr(&amp;quot;href&amp;quot;,”function(index, value) {
            if (value) {
              if (value.substr(0, 1) !== &amp;quot;/“)“{
                value = url + value
              }

              return url + value
            } else {
              console.log(“Weird.”,”index, value)
            }
          })
        })&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/deckgo-highlight-code&gt;
      
&lt;p&gt;I think convert all the links to absolute instead of relative values.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;deckgo-highlight-code language=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;
          &lt;code slot=&quot;code&quot;&gt;const text = htmlToText.fromString($.html(), {
  wordwrap: 130,
})

const inlined = juice($.html())&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/deckgo-highlight-code&gt;
      
&lt;p&gt;Then I render a compile the rendered html into a text format as well for raw-text newsletter rendering, as well as inlining all of the css.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;deckgo-highlight-code language=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;
          &lt;code slot=&quot;code&quot;&gt;      // Write HTML
      fs.writeFile(file, inlined, err =&amp;gt; {
        if (err) {
          reject()
          console.error(`Inline CSS error on write file:\n\n${err}`)
        }
        resolve()
      })

      // Write Text
      fs.writeFile(file.split(&amp;quot;.&amp;quot;)[0] + &amp;quot;.txt&amp;quot;, text, err =&amp;gt; {
        if (err) {
          reject()
          console.error(`Inline CSS error on write file:\n\n${err}`)
        }
        resolve()
      })
    })
  })
  await Promise.all(inlined)&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/deckgo-highlight-code&gt;
      
&lt;p&gt;Finally, I write the converted and inlined file back to disc, and also add a text file to be used in the newsletter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All and all, this isn’t the cleanest way to approach it, but it works pretty well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last but not least, I write everything to the mail server and create a new campaign using the &lt;a href=&quot;https://sendy.co/api&quot;&gt;Sendy API&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t actually have this implemented, but it would look something like this.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;deckgo-highlight-code language=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;
          &lt;code slot=&quot;code&quot;&gt;  return fetch(&amp;quot;url+&amp;quot;/api/campaigns/create.php&amp;quot;, {
    method: &amp;quot;POST&amp;quot;,
    mode: &amp;quot;no-cors&amp;quot;,
    credentials: &amp;quot;same-origin&amp;quot;,
    headers: {
      &amp;quot;Content-Type&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;application/x-www-form-urlencoded&amp;quot;,
    },
    body: new URLSearchParams({
		plaintext: text,
		html: inlined,
		title: title,
		from_name: config.from,
		from_email: config.email,
		reply_to: config.replyto,
      list: config.listid,
      boolean: true,
      subform: true,
    }),
  })&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/deckgo-highlight-code&gt;
      
&lt;h2&gt;Reflecting&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So. Overall, this has been a fun way to learn the details of how Gatsby works, and certainly reflected my workflow. Also, development time aside, the bulk of the TIME spent on the newsletter is content focused, which is exactly what I wanted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love that the newsletters are their own discrete markdown product, stored as files and folder structures, and just clean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, there’s been a few weak points.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, I want to create more of a database style approach to the voices, as my hope is to (over time) curate a list of incredible global designers who deserve a stronger voice. Those voices shouldn’t be confined only to that particular newsletter, so I need to figure out a way to address that part.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, the jobs have been a big point of value for folk, and having a more consistent job board for global design roles is something I’d like to emphasize. Likewise, that needs a CMS or board, not just a newsletter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Third, the essays interconnect conceptually such that I’d like to explore different approaches to linking and referencing, even within a series. So far I’m just linking to things, but there might be a better way to approach that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, the production part of this newsletter is confined to my computer, and so I rely on copying things over to Gatsby and that 15 or so minutes of getting everything compiled and rendering properly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, all told, I actually think in the future I may re-write the Diverge site and workflow to support a headless CMS as my platform, as a relational database of some sort seems to be the next step. I’m likely to go with something like Strapi or Netlify’s CMS, but haven’t really decided yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the interim though, I’ll be writing Diverge each week somewhere in my beloved markdown editor, trying to figure out how I get everything together before Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why is it that we can see something coming and still not prepare? I’ve been asking myself this the past 10 days that we’ve been on lock-down here in Denmark. While we set ourselves up pretty well (how is besides the point here), we set ourselves up in a very general way. We have some medical supplies and training, we have food, we can keep ourselves and our son protected… we think. But what if we could be more specific?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was this question that spurred my wife &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.aylanewhousedesign.com/&quot;&gt;Ayla&lt;/a&gt; (a design director at Fjord) and I (design all-arounder and co-design consultant) to do what we have consistently done in our relationship: turn to goddamn post-it notes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We realized that we needed a different tool to deal with this complexity, and so we created a game. It’s not — strictly speaking — a particularly fun game. It’s not dealing with a particularly fun topic. But it follows that structure and it was (and is) useful to us. &lt;strong&gt;This is a long post: if you want to jump to the rules and the tools we created, just head to the end.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Anxiety, Collected&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our first task was to enumerate our anxieties. That was fun.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sickness and death in our family (all on another continent), our son Emil getting sick, losing our job(s), overwhelmed public health systems, closed borders, and economic bailouts failing were the obvious near term concerns. Greater extremes came quickly after: governments focusing on their citizens above foreigners (we’re foreign workers in Denmark), seized assets. Even broader: what of a European Union unable to fulfill its “union” mandate? What of existing fragility and its fallout, such as armed conflict between Turkey and Russia?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These anxieties are overwhelming when taken together, and can quickly spiral. I’d argue they are effectively the same as reaching out frantically in the dark from ones current position. What we needed is a way to tackle these anxieties in sequence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the past, we’ve often use a tool like &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backcasting&quot;&gt;backcasting&lt;/a&gt;: looking at a future or point in time that we WANTED to get to, and figuring out what are the steps required to get there. But we aren’t in that kind of situation. &lt;strong&gt;We aren’t defining a strategy so much as developing a posture from which to engage whatever the world is throwing at us in a time of extreme uncertainty.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We want to build our resilience. We know (insomuch as one can) where we are right now: so what does it mean to scout forwards in time?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Anxiety, Organized&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our next step was to simply cluster the anxieties where they seem to make sense. A few obvious ones emerged:&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Environment&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These were things like “one of us gets sick”, “Emil gets sick”, or “One of us loses our job.” Events that we are living with in a time of change or decision making. Something that is probably traumatic, but also something that frankly most of us will be experiencing in some way over the coming months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Resources&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These started as inflection points, things like “hospitals get filled to capacity”, “No testing means no idea of actual risk”, and “Internet rationing or curfews.” But these clusters could be simplified down to “Public Health”, “Risk Appetite”, and “Community and Connection” respectively. Either private or public resources that shape outcomes. There’s a cluster of other ones as well, including Cash, Consumables and Food, Sanity, etc. Ultimately, anything that is a resource in balance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Inflection Point&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inflection Points are specifically in tension with the Environment category, and have a lot of overlap. These are mostly framed as a CHANGE that we will have to make a decision around. An example we listed is that “Denmark starts emphasizing Danish citizens over foreigners for medical care” (unlikely but possible), “Indefinite Lockdown is announced”, and “No one is Hiring.” In each of these cases, it requires a non-obvious response given the reality we find ourselves in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Catastrophe&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, we have a “catastrophe” category, which is something that throws an already vulnerable situation into complete chaos. This might be the death of a parent or partner, assets being frozen (for whatever reason), a national or international crisis, or — most likely — a full recession. Significantly, these are things that might actually be quite probable: but their likelihood doesn’t dilute the extreme emotional, financial, physical, and psychological impact of the event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Anxieties, Iterated&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, one axis became time extending from now, +3mo, +6mo, +12mo, + 18mo, and +36 months. Then the other axis became the the “order” of decision: environment to resources, resources to inflection point, inflection to catastrophe with the two assessments beside it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Setting the Scene&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, &lt;strong&gt;Environment&lt;/strong&gt; cards were chosen based off of what we were facing right now. (We started with one of us being sick, though hopefully we aren’t). Then looked at the &lt;strong&gt;resources&lt;/strong&gt; that we had access to and what we were lacking. In the above scenario, we’re well set up for supplies and consumables, but honestly, don’t feel well covered by the the public health system. This is an entirely subjective judgement: we might actually be well covered, but it’s just the feel there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, we move on to the &lt;strong&gt;Inflection Point&lt;/strong&gt;, which in this case is the made-up “Denmark explicitly emphasizes Danish citizen wellbeing over foreign residents.” This being purely speculative, we wanted to explore what would happen.&lt;/p&gt;

After we laid out these four cards, along the “Now” time, we asked ourselves: “Okay, what would we do?” And at this first assessment, there actually wasn’t much. Even in a scenario where we were sick and our health as foreign workers was being devalued, we’re healthy, have resources, and have a community. So we decided that we’d simply stay home, and try to weather this sickness as best we can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Second Assessment&lt;/h3&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
Then we rolled a dice. Each of our catastrophy cards we had labeled with a number, since for this initial exercise we only had a few. And it rolled a 4: “A Death In the Family.” &lt;strong&gt;This was the moment where the game hit home and we both said “Fuck” in unison.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a scenario where our own health was at risk and we had made the decision to shelter in place, suddenly our sibling or our parent calls us with crushing news. We’re between an 8 and 12 hour flight back — itself a multiple of risk to ourselves, our loved ones, and those whose paths are simply coincident with our own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is where the second assessment took place. We listed what would likely have to happen: hunker in place. Look after our physical health. Look after our mental health. Find a grief councillor who can work with us remotely. Redouble our efforts to stay connected with family. Take on the responsibility of planning and estate considerations, or support the family member who does.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Next Turn&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exhausted by this, we drew the next card: 3 months from now, in June. Suddenly, one of us is unemployed. We select our resources: we have good savings, but in such a situation our risk tolerance is going to drop (meaning why might not be able to jump on opportunities like we had in the past). Then a corresponding inflection point: “No one is hiring.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We laid out our first assessment, which actually did not look too different from what we would do outside of a pandemic and looming recession. But the catastrophe card threw this into stark relief: the borders were fully locked down. Suddenly, even though we had not been planning a move, the scope of potential forward actions dramatically shrunk. Maybe the embassy? What do we do?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Anxieties, Acknowledged&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We played several rounds of this, seeing another family member pass, seeing cabin fever set in, and finally seeing both of us face unemployment. Each of these turns as the marched forward in time prompted stark decision making and discussions on what might come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, we looked at our decisions and took stock — what comes next? If these things might happen, what can we do now to offset the risk? If joblessness is a likelihood (or at least distinct possibility), can we plan our capital and budget accordingly now as though we anticipate that? If the death of a family member is possible in the near term instead of the indeterminate future, what needs to happen?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This wasn’t a fun game.&lt;/strong&gt; It was upsetting, painful, and anxiety inducing. But though crudely simulating what might come, it helped map out many of the blindspots and fragilities we’ve had all along. And maybe, if we run through a few more times, it’ll mean we’re in a better posture when the time to act comes.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Rules of Play&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay. The above was a long diatribe about why we made this. Here’s the TL;DR on the rules and how to play.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Setup the Board&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;List out everything you’re thinking about on posits or small squares of paper.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Organize into:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Environment (something ongoing, like sickness or unemployment)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Resources (cash, community, etc)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Inflection (an event that forces a decision)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Catastrophe (something big and unexpected)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wildcard (Something possible but very unlikely, like a shooting war between Russia and Turkey or the EU collapsing)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Create two axis:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;one of time starting from now,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;one with environment, positive resource, negative resource, inflection, catastrophe, wildcard. Then two more columns: Assessment 1, Assessment 2&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/f87d372c75f53c5a605f786953391152/canvas.pdf&quot;&gt;You can download the canvas here&lt;/a&gt;
We didn’t play with the wildcards initially, so didn’t include that on the canvas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;First Round&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Select an “Environment,” either what you’re must worried about now or what is already the case. Put that on “Now” and “Environment”. Then select two resource cards for what you have access to (positive) and what you are missing (negative). Then select a random inflection card.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Think about what you would do in this scenario and discuss. What do you hope you’d have? What kind of decision would you make? Write it down on a posit and put it in assessment #1.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Then roll a dice or select a catastrophe card at random. Put it in the catastrophe slot.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reflect and discuss on the new scenario given your previous decision. What changes? What can you do? How bad are things? What opportunities might exist? Write down your reflection and put it in assessment 2.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Normally the round is over, but if you want to add something, add an additional wildcard and an assessment #3.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Subsequent Rounds&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each round builds on the last, so if your next time slot is three months from now, then it is following the decisions you made in the “Now” timeslot. Simply follow the same steps as the first round and see where it takes you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Reflection&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Play until you feel like you have an idea of what might come. Before wrapping up, look at your assessments. What can you learn in terms to preparing for some of these worst cases now? Is there anything you need? Decisions you need to make? Process to put in place?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then if you like, play another round with a different starting point. Who knows what different decisions you might make, and what you might discover you’ll need on the other side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Resources&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;
With the coronavirus probably hitching a ride in one of your co-workers, it’s possible that your work (especially if you exist in that oh-so-nebulous world of knowledge work) is implementing a more permissive remote work policy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of you will think “I can’t do that.” Many of you might be right, since a lot of very real, outcome-driving work happens in the interstitial space between “actual work” and socializing.  But I would suggest that there is a  balance to be struck that will allow you to work remotely or mostly remotely, thereby reducing your risk of exposure (or at least &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2020/3/6/21161234/coronavirus-covid-19-science-outbreak-ends-endemic-vaccine&quot;&gt;flattening the curve&lt;/a&gt; so that local healthcare systems don’t get overwhelmed).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve been working mostly remotely since mid 2017, when I realized with a bit of a shock that the fellowship I had accepted was for a remote team. Turns out it works out well, but oh my god, was the learning curve painful. Currently, I work mostly remotely as a product manager, a job that I would not have guessed would  fit that mode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So here are a few tips on the remote work thing, with the goal of inspiring you to give it a try.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Create an Accountability Structure&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the biggest thing and also should be table stakes. Some folk have intense internalized accountability, and they might just get the work done because of fear, pride, whatever. I’m not one of those. I am both very goal-oriented and very exploration-motivated, so I’ll work frantically and gleefully, but my attention will turn on a dime without some accountability structure to keep it in place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For me, what I found worked best was consistent deadlines and dramatic transparency about responsibilities. Every week I broadcast to the team my goals, deadlines, and expected outcomes as a baseline, and then run my team’s product specific standup. I also keep a lot of documentation. 90% of that isn’t read until it’s needed, or not at all, but the act of documenting helps makes things concrete, and it’s a motivator for me knowing its done and making it public to the team. Currently, I run the documentation with Notion, where I keep everything from year-scoped strategy, to feature specs and data models, to weekly notes and to-do lists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Over Communicate, but Not Like That&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Language by itself is low bandwidth. The reason why face-to-face meetings are so vital is that trust is built through being in the room, showing openness, communicating physically, demonstrating emotion, taking risk, etc. There’s a lot communicated outside of just words. Unfortunately, one of those things might be coronavirus. So let’s compromise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can work remotely and still have high bandwidth communication. &lt;em&gt;What you shouldn’t do is be a sociopath on Slack&lt;/em&gt;. Not everything needs to be liked, but communication and requests DO need to be acknowledged. Not everyone needs to see the gif, but sometimes a gif drives the point home. Basically, focus on the quality of your communication and the context that it creates, instead of becoming a one-human version of the PRC’s surveillance state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A concrete example: your team’s engineer shares what she just pushed to staging, asking for feedback. You acknowledge and give a timeframe for feedback, so expectations are set. Somewhere in that time period, give it a look. Instead of just rambling off feedback in slack, make a list. Open a notes application (I use BearApp) or your issue tracking software, and make a list of what you’re seeing. Maybe take some screenshots, maybe record a screencast of a bug. Copy and paste your feedback (or links to the feedback) into a slack thread responding to the request, and tag the engineer in your response so she knows that the feedback is there. Probably you’ll have a discussion about it. Probably everything will move on easily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this case, the communication is focused, high quality, but also flexible enough to respond to the needs of the problem and is pretty damn fast. When so much of communication is performance, the thing you need to be “performing” when working remotely is competence and a focus on outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Take Your Damn Breaks and Put On Some Pants&lt;/h2&gt;

Once you get used to working remotely and find your stride, it can be very, very easy to suddenly wake up on the other side of the day with a brilliantly demolished to-do list, but no clothes and a hole where lunch was supposed to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love the experience of being so engrossed in making something, I don’t even notice time and the world passing by. That’s gotten a bit less desirable now that I’m a parent (because I want to be spending that time with my son, frankly), but nonetheless it can be great feeling if you like and value your work. However, it can also be unhealthy and unsustainable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When colocated with other workers (i.e. in an office), there is rarely continuous flow. You get up, you stretch, you get coffee, you run an errand, you get pulled into a brainstorm, you chat with a colleague about their weekend, you play foosball, you get your ass handed to you because you grew up in Canada without a foosball table and why are all the European designers so absurdly good at this game and ugh whatever. The work day has its core of work, but this core is supported by the daily conversations, rituals, and inefficiencies that being human brings with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some folk use things like Pomodoro or “stand up” reminders to keep themselves on track. I occasionally use a countdown clock called a Time Timer if I need to do something that I desperately don’t want to do, but just needs to get done. It’s like a time prison. But mostly, I wouldn’t do that. Maybe set a reminder for yourself if you find you missed lunch once or twice. Make a point of getting up to get water, or treating yourself to lunch outside of the house. The point is to create rituals and habits, so that healthy breaks from your work are not only consistent but also so obvious as to be practically invisible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Be Aware of Dead Reckoning&lt;/h2&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;
Things slip. It’s just how it goes. With every decision, and action, a little bit of error is introduced into the system. With each subsequent action, a little bit more error is introduced, and over time, these errors compound and you’re not where you  thought you were. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the essence of dead reckoning: a navigation technique that takes your previous position and estimates your current position based off of speed, travel time, etc. Except every position determined from dead reckoning is an estimate, not the truth. And so to reduce the error on that estimate, we need a way of identifying that “truth.” This cuts across the two big risks of remote work: 1) alignment with your team and stakeholders, and 2) actual delivery of value when outside of a co-located accountability structure. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we work outside of the co-located office, we lose the ease with which alignment can happen on a team working towards a common goal. This alignment certainly isn’t always correct, but it’s easier for the team mindset to take over. When working remotely, it’s easy to look at a low-bandwidth message on Slack or Microsoft Teams (which is terrible) and infer alignment from shared language used. But the mental model that you and your other conversant might hold can diverge pretty wildly, and lacking the added nuance of higher bandwidth modes of communication (like face-to-face, or as I like to call it, corona-close) the signal that you’re actually misaligned might not show up until it is too late. As a general rule, any time someone says “Great, we’re aligned on that” I take a minute to spell out exactly what it is that I’m doing next.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Be Kind To Yourself&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, be kind to yourself and others who are trying remote work for the first time. It’s not going to be for everyone. It might suck, it might be awesome, but it’ll absolutely be different. Give yourself space to fail the first month or two, and be open about what’s working and not working with your colleagues. Please extend the same generosity of spirit to them as well, and experiment with different tools, processes, and similar until you find something that sticks. With my current team, we’ve been through three different tools and several rounds of iteration before we hit something that really feels comfortable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, this need to work remotely is coming from an inherent fragility in our existing ways of working. Flatter organizations and open office environments can certainly lead to a stronger network effect and more co-creation within organizations, but it also gets you Gweneth Paltrow in Contagion (which I’m guessing was cross-marketing for Goop?).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I hope this helps. Don’t go too far down the productivity rabbit hole, but rather be reflective, be communicative, and be kind to yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This was my term paper for the first module in my Security Studies MA, written December 2019. Sharing here as a writing sample and because I enjoyed the process of writing it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The relationship between terrorism and failing states has an intuitive ring to it. As then-US Senator and later Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel argued in 2004, “Terrorism finds sanctuary in failed or failing states, in unresolved regional conflicts, and in the misery of endemic poverty and despair” (Hagel, 2004, p. 65). However, the true association is more suspect. The goal of this essay is to interrogate this relationship by deconstructing the value-driven language of terrorism and failing states, exploring the evidence that illuminates the complexity of the relationship, and considering what emerges from that complexity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While exploring examples primarily from Afghanistan and Somalia, as well as broader reaching empirical work, I conclude that the rhetorical relationship between terrorism and failing states is one of convenient adjacencies, rather than one intrinsic to the nature of failing states that causes terrorism to emerge. To the contrary, while failing states can serve as bases of operations for terrorist organizations, they also present considerable operational complexity engaged out of necessity, not desirability. The convenient rhetorical framing of failing states as a source of terrorism falls short of acknowledging this, instead activating value-laden and state-centric language to construct a state-level response to what is usually a sub- or non-state threat. Ultimately, the association between terrorism and failing states has emerged as a point of operational circumstance for the terrorists and a point of rhetorical convenience for their opponents, resulting in the failing state label exacerbating the existing dimensions of state failure. Finally, we will consider the opportunity cost in lives and capital by which this convenience is purchased, and how it might be spent differently or not at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Defining Terrorism&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to consider its relationship to failing states, terrorism must be deconstructed through the actions it engages in and upon what scope it operates. Terrorism is difficult to define, but is overwhelming framed by its application of violence to political ends (Duyvesteyn, 2004, p. 440) and often against civilian targets (Burke, 2008, p. 39). However, as Shanahan points out in his exploration of the definition of terrorism by states and academic sources, “no two are identical, and there are significant differences among them” (Shanahan, 2010, p. 176). By focusing too deeply on isolating a definition of terrorism as a generalized act, the term itself loses its value as an analytical unit rooted in the political context of its execution (Dexter, 2012, p. 124). In order to ground an analysis of the relationship between terrorism and failing states, then terrorism must be situated in a space, a time, and an actor-based context to hold relevance. Using this lens, the primary unit of comparative analysis I focus on is actors and organizations who conduct terrorist activities, instead of the abstract idea of terrorism itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Situating terrorism enables an exploration of the organizations and individuals responsible for terrorism within the context of failing states. Terrorist organizations engage in terrorist acts; they are organizations of individuals who conduct politically motivated violence often against civilian targets. Terrorist organizations are often “small organizations operating somewhat secretly without the power to take and hold territory” (Shapiro, 2013, p. 2), situating the definition in the covert and the asymmetric with regards to power. While there are many different types of terrorism (Jackson, 2011, p. 152), this framing permits a focus on international and domestic terrorism conducted by non-state and sub-state actors. Specifically, state terrorism is omitted in this consideration as outside of the scope of this analysis, although it does not to diminish the role that state terrorism holds in any broad definitional discussion on terrorism and its human impact (Jackson, 2011, pp. 183–195). In considering the connection between terrorism and failing states, state terrorism demonstrates how state-level actors wield the instruments of the state against its citizens and enemies domestically and internationally (Jackson, 2011, pp. 183–187). Observing a failing state engaging in state terrorism would present a different focus of analysis: that of state terrorism contributing or resulting from state failure versus separate coinciding phenomena executed by some entity other than the state or political elite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, the definition of terrorism in this analysis is necessarily one which is situated in time and space through its organizational structure, observable in that they have engaged in the act of terrorism and can be considered in historical and regional context, and distinct from the state and its institutions. One can contrast two maligned organization to exemplify the definition: before the US invasion, al-Qa’ida was considered a sub-state terrorist organization as it engaged in international terrorism and existed as separate but supported by the Taliban-controlled state of Afghanistan (National Commission on Terrorist Attacks upon the United States, 2004, pp. 50–52). Despite being a bureaucracy situated in Afghanistan (Byman, 2019, p. 68), al-Qa’ida remained organizationally distinct and often ideologically opposed to the Taliban (Byman, 2019, pp. 60–61). The Taliban is a state level actor that — while arguably engaging in state terrorism against its own population under its construction of Shari’a law (Hehir, 2007, p. 319) — held territory and otherwise wielded the apparats of state (National Commission on Terrorist Attacks upon the United States, 2004, pp. 63–67). The Taliban even engaged in (unhelpful) dialogue with the United States as a state-based power (National Commission on Terrorist Attacks upon the United States, 2004, pp. 110–111). By focusing on terrorism as situated in organizations and thereby an observable phenomenon, it becomes possible to explore how two separated concepts — terrorism as an observable phenomenon and failing states as a label to their cultural and political context — can co-construct a threat narrative to a given state’s national security interest so great as to justifying costly intervention (Hehir, 2007, pp. 310–311) and state reconstruction (Krasner and Pascual, 2005, pp. 153, 163). But having defined terrorism in these terms, what is this label of the failing state?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Defining Failing States&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a Washington Post op-ed, then US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice wrote “The greatest threats to our security are defined more by the dynamics within weak and failing states than by the borders between strong and aggressive ones” (Rice, 2005). This statement reflected a feeling that was prevalent in the United States and its allies following the attacks of 2001 and had been percolating since the collapse of the Soviet Union: that while western liberal democracy was seen as ascendant, threats existed to the liberal democratic order that were best solved by the promotion of democracy abroad (Hehir, 2007, pp. 321–332; Verhoeven, 2009, pp. 407–408). Only a few months earlier, Secretary Rice’s teams proposed a new agency to engage in country reconstruction stating that “elements of state weakness constitute structural threats akin to dead leaves that accumulate in a forest. No one knows what spark will ignite them, or when. Over the long run, the only real way to create lasting peace is to promote better governance” (Krasner and Pascual, 2005, p. 155). In this view, failing states manifest insecurity through the complexity of potential emanating threats — refugees, drugs, disease, and most importantly in this discussion, terrorism­ — within their borders (Simons and Tucker, 2007, p. 387). By way of example, in the mid 2000s, over a decade of domestic conflict within Somalia had seen the rise of a burgeoning and popular Islamic governing coalition: the Council of Islamic Courts (CIC) (Menkhaus, 2007, pp. 364–365). In this case, certain members of that coalition – specifically al-Shebaab – were understood to be aligned with al-Qa’ida, but little evidence seemed to exist that they were a new franchisee of al-Qa’ida (Byman, 2019, pp. 159–160). Despite this, the association was leveraged to construct a now-familiar narrative that failing states breed terrorism: a frame that the Ethiopian military used to generate a rationale for intervention and recruit American support. The threat of terrorism to Ethiopia and America, and therefore the imperative to intervene in Somalia, were grounded in the probability ­— and not the certitude — of a threat (Verhoeven, 2009, pp. 416–417). This example suggests that failing states do not pose a deterministic threat (as a hostile nation with a standing army might), but rather represent a source of emergent and unpredictable insecurity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, any of these aforementioned threats can emerge from within otherwise economically stable, western nations. One need only consider the Irish Republican Army and its offshoots in the United Kingdom (Jackson, 2011, pp. 33, 131) as an obvious example. So if the security outcomes of failing states can manifest in non-failing states, what exactly is a failed, failing, fragile, or weak state in the first place? The Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA) has a helpful definition:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Though no universal definition of ‘fragile state’ exists, states are perceived as fragile when the government does not demonstrate the will and/or capacity to deliver on core state functions such as the enforcement of legitimate security and authority, the protection, promotion and implementation of human rights and gender equality, the rule of law, and even the most basic provision of services (e.g., in health and education, in enabling the private sector, and in environmental protection). When these core state functions are unreliable or inaccessible, the legitimacy of the state erodes and is likely to result in a breakdown in the social ‘pact’ of trust and cooperation within civil society and between civil society and the state.”(Keating, 2016, p. 12)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This definition presents two helpful insights. First, it hints at the idea of failed, failing, fragile, and weak states existing along a continuum: that perhaps rule of law might function, but gender equality might not. As Simons and Tucker point out, “entire regions don’t collapse; entire states never fail. Not everything falls apart, even when there is no government control” (Simons and Tucker, 2007, p. 391). With this in mind, I primarily frame state failure as situated upon a multidimensional continuum within the context of a given “failing” state relative to a western liberal ideal (Bøås and Jennings, 2005, p. 387).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second insight within the CIDA definition is that the “human security” paradigm undergirds this framing of failing states. Human security proposes a shift away from the state as the operational unit of analysis, instead focusing on the individual as the referent object in considering issues of development and security, as well as a more multidimensional framing of what constitutes a threat to the security and dignity of the individual (Bøås and Jennings, 2005, p. 389; McCormack, 2011, pp. 238–239). In the CIDA framing of fragile states, the legitimacy and stability of a state seems to break down as its capacity to engage in the economic, legal, and physical security of the individual degrades. But as McCormack points out, this breakdown of individual rights provides a path via the language of human security to frame failing states as threats to powerful states (McCormack, 2011, p. 244), thereby situating these weaker states as a risk in the national security discourse of relatively more powerful and nominally stable state actors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If failing states are measured along a continuum of adherence to the economic and physical security of the individual which itself is a measure of adherence to values espoused by a frame constructed by the institutions of a western liberal order (McCormack, 2011, pp. 243–244), then ultimately, the label of failing states is a normative construct describing state-based relationships and policy along the sliding scale of a western liberal value structure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having established that terrorism exists in the context of sub- or non-state organizations that engage in terrorist activity and that failing states are constructed in relation to international power dynamics, what are we to do with the assertion that failing states are emergent sources of terrorism (Piazza, 2006, p. 159; Newman, 2007, p. 463; Simons and Tucker, 2007, p. 387)? In the empirical discourse exploring this relationship, there seems to be only a loose association between failing states and terrorism (Piazza, 2006, pp. 172–174; Newman, 2007, pp. 483–484).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Significant amongst the conclusions is that while terrorist organizations and action can occur within the context of failing states, they can also — and in fact are more likely to — manifest in stable ones (Newman, 2007, p. 483). This observation supports the threat construction drive behind the application of failing state labels to a given national context, and serves to structure a potential counter-narrative to the emergence of terrorism in failing states: one that suggests that the risk and complexity presented by failing states can be as likely to undermine terrorist organizations as they are to support their endeavours which often rely upon access to infrastructure, communication, and resources (Hehir, 2007, p. 321). In contrast, state institutions in stable and/or democratic states may serve to benefit more clandestine or nascent terrorist organizations through access to welfare systems and the freedom to operate and recruit through the protection of free speech (Hehir, 2007, p. 320). In other words, failing states fail terrorists too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If terrorist organizations are as likely to emerge in more stable and wealthier nations, then why the connection between failing states and terrorism? Newman observes that while the actual level of terrorist activity is relatively low, the most destructive terrorist groups are located in failing states (Newman, 2007, p. 475,483). Al-Qa’ida has existed for decades as a terrorist organization in opposition to the Russians before it committed the most lethal terrorist attack the world has seen since the 1960s (Jackson, 2011, p. 135), but it was this singular and horrifying attack that transformed routine counter-terrorist activities (National Commission on Terrorist Attacks upon the United States, 2004, p. 115) into a global War on Terror (Jackson, 2011, p. 250). If acts of terror serve as a perverse form of political communication by terrorist organizations (Jackson, 2011, p. 116), states are also able to leverage their institutional and rhetorical powers to offset and combat this violent communication, such as by framing the fight against al-Qa’ida as part of a broader War on Terror (Jackson, 2011, pp. 62–63) or by labeling their supporters as failing states (Simons and Tucker, 2007, pp. 388–389). This not only serves to mobilize resources on the local level, but also to recruit other state and institutional actors to its on security needs (Buzan, 2006, pp. 1103–1104). The effect of this approach is tragically exemplified in the American failure to acknowledge the Somali Council of Islamic Courts as a legitimate state actor, and instead — as they had with the Taliban — situated them as first-and-foremost al-Qa’ida supporters (Menkhaus, 2007, pp. 377–378). This framing served as justification for an escalation and eventual invasion of Somalia by Ethiopian forces, a decision that threw a failing state rebuilding itself from within back into chaos (Verhoeven, 2009, pp. 416–417). So while Somalia is functionally the working model of the failing state (Verhoeven, 2009, p. 406), in this instance the label becomes self-fulfilling in the eyes of more powerful state actors and undermined the efforts of an otherwise potentially legitimate and effective local governing coalition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the case of Afghanistan, it appear as though the label of failing state was constructed not by its consideration relative to human security factors — though it certainly existed along that continuum (Hehir, 2007, pp. 318–319) — but by the terrorism of al-Qa’ida and the threat narrative constructed as a consequence of the 9/11 attacks. As Shapiro points out:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“What made Afghanistan so useful to al-Qa’ida from 1995 onward was not an absence of state institutions; it was that al-Qa’ida could operate under the protection of a sovereign state, relying on that state’s sovereignty to shield its infrastructure from potential attack by Western forces.” (Shapiro, 2013, p. 268)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When that sovereignty was undermined through the labeling of Afghanistan as a failing state — an action catalyzed by al-Qa’ida’s actions — the previous security and support that al-Qa’ida enjoyed (Hehir, 2007, pp. 318–319) was rapidly stripped away, and the organization was forced to adapt. Terrorist organizations are constantly managing their capacity to remain covert while still retaining a level of command-and-control over their operations, their ideology, and their resources (Shapiro, 2013, p. 8). Shapiro makes the argument that dramatic reductions in centralized control towards the more informal networked structure that has become a defining trait of al-Qa’ida is a response to an increasingly desperate security situation for the organization (Shapiro, 2013, p. 270). This suggests quite the opposite hypothesis to the dominant narrative about failing states and terrorism: that failing states present similarly complex operational or even existential challenges to terrorist organizations as they do to state actors. As Simons and Tucker point out, “terrorists also need a modicum of stability, they wouldn’t set themselves up in a collapsed state where they potentially become a bargaining chip between local factions” (Simons and Tucker, 2007, p. 398).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;If Not From Failing States&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If terrorist organizations are not a phenomenon emerging from failing states, then they must come from somewhere. World leaders can be said to acknowledge that the threat of terrorism is not bound to the traditional statist lens, as then-Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld did when he said “There may not be as many beachheads stormed as opportunities denied. Forget about ‘exit strategies’; we’re looking at a sustained engagement that carries no deadlines” (Rumsfeld, 2001). In this view, conflicts with terrorist organizations are multidimensional and complex: lacking a single situated location but rather lurking behind the “bankers’ pinstripes”, the “programmers’ grunge”, and certainly “desert camouflage” (Rumsfeld, 2001). Unfortunately, this statement may have proven prescient. The 9/11 hijackers came from diverse, generally privileged, and educated backgrounds across the Arab world (Friedman, 2017), empowering them to engage in a complex and covert terrorist act at an international scale. While stochastic events like the major international attacks of 9/11 belie reasonable prediction, the next big terrorist organization is likely to emerge from complexity: where population, diversity, and stressing factors like state repression converge (Piazza, 2006, p. 170).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, the conclusion I draw is that the terrorism of situated terrorist organizations can emerge anywhere, and that failing states are not significantly more likely to give rise to these groups and actions than stable states (Newman, 2007, pp. 483–484). Instead, if we acknowledge that failing states exist along a continuum of failing, then a potential way forward is to explore how specific populations at risk of radicalization might be failed by the state and its institutions, as “all states consistently fail some portions of their population” (Simons and Tucker, 2007, p. 400). This framing allows us to shift the language of failing states away from the unit of the state and its potential as a threat, and onto the specifics of how, where, and by what degree the state is failing the individual.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This shift away from the state-level of analysis points to effective ways in which the emergence of terrorist organizations can be stymied at the local level (Simons and Tucker, 2007, pp. 394–400). As Shapiro observes, terrorist organizations face a dilemma in which control and efficiency are in tension with security and covertness (Shapiro, 2013, p. 56). While the failure of state institutions can serve to shift their focus towards security as with al-Qa’ida after the retreat of the Taliban from state power, we should consider how else to put maximum pressure on terrorist organizations in order to undermine their ability to execute in a coherent and centralized fashion (Shapiro, 2013, p. 270). Simons and Tucker’s suggestion that engagement with local forms of governance and alliance outside of the norms articulated in the failing-versus-stable-state narrative (as constructed by the principles of human security) might be one path towards putting that pressure on terrorist organizations (Simons and Tucker, 2007, pp. 397–398). In the case of Afghanistan, they point out that: “Westerners seldom look at the world the way non-Western locals do, and thus seldom know where or how to look for what terrorists might be up to.” (Simons and Tucker, 2007, p. 396) By engaging critically with the dimensions through which a state (either ones own or another’s) fails some group or individual, then perhaps the voids and vacuums in which a terrorist threat might take root can be ferreted out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Terrorism does not emerge from failing states any more than it emerges from stable ones (Newman, 2007). Rather, terrorism emerges from terrorist organizations, which in turn emerge and are situated where diverse populations come into conflict (Piazza, 2006, p. 170). Similarly, failing states do not emerge from terrorism, though as we have seen in the case of Somalia (Menkhaus, 2007; Verhoeven, 2009) and Afghanistan (Hehir, 2007; Simons and Tucker, 2007; Shapiro, 2013), situated terrorism can serve to rationalize the failing state label when applied by powerful state and institutional actors like the United States (Bøås and Jennings, 2005, p. 387).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this analysis, it can be concluded that terrorism and failing states do not have a causal relationship, but rather a relativistic normative relationship can be constructed by elite, state, and institutional actors in order to functionally engage with the terrorist organization, the so-called failing state, or both (Hehir, 2007, p. 328). But if the label of failing state is one that can be constructed, then it can be dismantled as well. The label of failing states should not be a sentence carried by an entire state, but rather its constituent dimensions — with the many ways in which a state is failing or succeeding — should be considered in turn (Simons and Tucker, 2007, p. 400). When an understanding of terrorism is situated and performed by an organization forced to operate in the liminal spaces of state failure (Shapiro, 2013, pp. 265–269), the path to effectively combatting terrorist organizations lies not in constructing sweeping relationships between terrorism and failing states, but in forming relationships with local inhabitants to co-create stability and security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wrote a rudimentary python script to bulk import your Audible library to Goodreads. I’ll caveat with a statement: this is still pretty manual, but it automates the parts that are most time consuming. Overall, it shouldn’t take more than 5min to get your whole audible library into Goodreads. Then maybe just re-run the process every few months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://gist.github.com/readywater/b71c11428a151654474cdb673756319e&quot;&gt;You can view the script here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Get Your Audible Data&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It procedurally builds off of another script that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.themodernnomad.com/audible-statistics-extractor/&quot;&gt;exports your audible library&lt;/a&gt; , which is required to get it working. To run this script, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.audible.com/lib?purchaseDateFilter=all&amp;#x26;programFilter=all&amp;#x26;sortBy=PURCHASE_DATE.dsc&amp;#x26;pageSize=50&quot;&gt;visit your audible library&lt;/a&gt; and run the script on each page by hitting &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;command-option J&lt;/code&gt; to open your console (in Chrome and most other browsers), and run this script (which is just a minified version of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.static-18.themodernnomad.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Audible-ScreenScraperJanuary2019.txt&quot;&gt;one linked above&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://gist.githubusercontent.com/readywater/b71c11428a151654474cdb673756319e/raw/02f4e875aa1e55986c6e08a9dffd818bd7d92163/minified_audible_table_generator.js&quot;&gt;Link to script&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This will grab your library and turn the page into an html table. You can then easily select all on this table and paste it into google sheets or excel. Make sure to remove the repeated header data, but keep the top line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You need to do this &lt;strong&gt;for each page&lt;/strong&gt; of the library, so if you have 50+ books, simply go through each. Save the output; you can keep the file in an excel format or export to CSV.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Convert the Data into a Goodreads Format&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From here, you’ll want to run &lt;a href=&quot;https://gist.github.com/readywater/b71c11428a151654474cdb673756319e&quot;&gt;the python script&lt;/a&gt;. Save the file to whatever directly you’ve stored your audible spreadsheet and open your terminal. On Mac, do this by typing &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;command space&lt;/code&gt; and writing &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;terminal&lt;/code&gt; in the spotlight search.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;deckgo-highlight-code language=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
          &lt;code slot=&quot;code&quot;&gt;import pandas as pd
from isbntools.app import *

df = pd.read_excel(r&amp;#39;/path/to/the/saved/excel.xlsx&amp;#39;)

# Fetch ISBN from title and author using isbn tools
df[&amp;#39;isbn&amp;#39;] = df.apply(lambda x : isbn_from_words(x.Title + &amp;quot; &amp;quot; + x.Author), axis=1 )
# Convert Dates
df[&amp;quot;Buy Date&amp;quot;] = pd.to_datetime(df[&amp;quot;Buy Date&amp;quot;], format=&amp;quot;%m-%d-%y&amp;quot;, exact=False).dt.strftime(&amp;#39;%Y-%m-%d&amp;#39;)
#df[&amp;quot;Buy Date&amp;quot;] = df[&amp;quot;Buy Date&amp;quot;]
# Add to audible
df[&amp;quot;Bookshelves&amp;quot;] = &amp;quot;audible&amp;quot;
# Map the Date Read to the Buy Date as a loose proxy
df[&amp;quot;Date Read&amp;quot;] = df.apply(lambda x: x[&amp;quot;Buy Date&amp;quot;] if x[&amp;quot;Time Left&amp;quot;] &amp;lt; 30 else None, axis=1)
# This doesn&amp;#39;t actually register, but the export that Goodreads provides is Exclusive Shelf for the read status
df[&amp;quot;Exclusive Shelf&amp;quot;] = df.apply(lambda x: &amp;quot;read&amp;quot; if x[&amp;quot;Time Left&amp;quot;] &amp;lt; 30 else &amp;quot;currently-reading&amp;quot; if x[&amp;quot;Time Left&amp;quot;]/x[&amp;quot;Minutes&amp;quot;] &amp;lt; .8 else &amp;quot;to-read&amp;quot;, axis=1)
# So I fix it by just appending the status to Bookshelves depending on read status. i.e. if less than 30min left, it&amp;#39;s read. If you&amp;#39;ve listened to more than 20% of it, it&amp;#39;s Currently Reading
df[&amp;quot;Bookshelves&amp;quot;] = df.apply(lambda x: x[&amp;quot;Bookshelves&amp;quot;] + &amp;quot; &amp;quot; + &amp;quot;read&amp;quot; if x[&amp;quot;Time Left&amp;quot;] &amp;lt; 30 else x[&amp;quot;Bookshelves&amp;quot;] + &amp;quot; &amp;quot; + &amp;quot;currently-reading&amp;quot; if x[&amp;quot;Time Left&amp;quot;]/x[&amp;quot;Minutes&amp;quot;] &amp;lt; .8 else x[&amp;quot;Bookshelves&amp;quot;] + &amp;quot; &amp;quot; + &amp;quot;to-read&amp;quot;, axis=1)
# Rename Buy Date to Date Added
df.rename(columns={&amp;quot;Buy Date&amp;quot; : &amp;quot;Date Added&amp;quot;},inplace = True)

df.to_csv(r&amp;#39;/path/to/export/audible-goodreads-import.csv&amp;#39;)
print (&amp;quot;Done&amp;quot;)&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/deckgo-highlight-code&gt;
      
&lt;p&gt;Before running the script, you’ll want to change two things. Open then python script and change line 17: &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;df = pd.read_excel(r’/path/to/the/saved/excel.xlsx’)&lt;/code&gt; to the path to your file and line 35: &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;df.to_csv(r’/path/to/export/audible-goodreads-import.csv’)&lt;/code&gt; to your export CSV format.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then simply run &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;py audible-goodreads-import.py&lt;/code&gt; in terminal, and you should get a file output with the CSV.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From there, simply &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/review/import&quot;&gt;go to your goodread account’s import page&lt;/a&gt; and follow the import instructions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It will import and update current read status, ratings, correct ISBN, and add it to an “audible” bookshelf.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Next steps&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hopefully this serves to compliment other solutions out there, or as a starting point for someone who wants to put together a better solution for non-technical folk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you encounter bugs or improve the script somehow, please leave a comment below or in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://gist.github.com/readywater/b71c11428a151654474cdb673756319e&quot;&gt;GitHub gist&lt;/a&gt;. If this works out for folk, I might put together something a bit more automated and a bit more user friendly eventually, but for a quick script thrown together while watching &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.netflix.com/dk-en/title/81026300&quot;&gt;Next in Fashion&lt;/a&gt;, this works nicely.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Decay of Digital Things]]></title><description><![CDATA[￼ Decay of Digital Things was a series of essays and a course at the Stanford d.school.

&lt;p&gt;Decay of Digital Things was a series of essays and a course at the Stanford d.school. The goal was the ask what happens to digital things when they get old — hardware, software, and networks. It was a fun and temporal project that had a big impact on my later thinking. It’s also something that others have asked me to re-upload, so I’m including what I could find here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href=&quot;reflection&quot;&gt;longer writeup&lt;/a&gt; about Decay was published in the 2018 book, &lt;a href=&quot;http://kairus.org/portfolio/book-the-internet-of-other-peoples-things/&quot;&gt;The Internet of Other People’s Things&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

I have an affinity for jackets and bags. The two central functions to protect and to carry somehow stand out in my mind as being what this whole clothing endeavour is about. In the quest for a more perfect bag and a more perfect jacket, I’ve tried many form factors and materials. However, somewhere along the line this search evolved into more of a collection than a solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taking stock of this jackets collection, I realized that many hadn’t been worn in some time and the same could be said for the rest of my wardrobe. I have my most comfortable quotidian wears, but a lot of the clothing that had inspired me up to the point of acquisition wasn’t being used according to that aspiration or inspiration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further, despite my attempts at the Marie Kondo approach (which definitely works), I’d hit a point of diminishing return. I really like the clothes that I have, though I suffer a bit from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.telegraph.co.uk/men/fashion-and-style/11432284/Blokewear-the-clothes-men-love-that-women-hate.html&quot;&gt;Blokewear&lt;/a&gt; thing between Engineered Garments’s infinity pockets and Acronym nerdy functionality. They fit an acquired, developed, or aspired style most times; they were mostly of a quality that was worth preserving and repairing vs. replacing; and sometimes there was even an emotional connection or story tied to them. So another option was needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A More Perfect Closet&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The digital closet is a trope that I’ve seen quite a bit from the tangible interface/new media world, not to mention the genius that is &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/XNDubWJU0aU&quot;&gt;Clueless&lt;/a&gt;. What if computers could help us look good with what we have (though software business models being what they are, our wardrobes would likely balloon), and make the inferences and connections between different pieces of clothing for us. No need for colour coordinating, fit experiments, or quotidian creativity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/92f371cb4ab7338a6afabd67f16a8d6a/clueless.gif&quot; alt=&quot;Clueless Wardrobe&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Elsewhere in my life, I’d been using different tools that “automated” the creative and planning side of personal fitness. Strava and TrainingPeaks both have scaling training plans that tie into your phone and your Garmin, effectually offloading the responsibility to plan and personalize. But I’ve come to believe this was creating an intellectual weakness in how I approached maintaining the body. When a training plan ended, or if I got knocked off it somehow by work, a cold, or travel, the return to that curated path felt unnatural. Despite the exhaustive metrics surrounding me, I didn’t know how I got there, so I didn’t know how (or why) to continue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More recently, I’ve been using plans from the MT Institute, which just come as a weekly list of “Do this.” There’s no tracking or technical sophistication: their app is basically just a text document with a password with a few links to youtube videoes for how to do certain exercises. It was infuriating at first. But because of that friction, it has forced a planning and engagement with my fitness that I haven’t had in years. Somewhat naturally by extension, I started to learn the how and why of getting somewhere and keeping going.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This relates to my wardrobe because the fabric we wrap ourselves in serves to work a kind of daily muscle. In some ways, we are incredibly constrained. We have a limited wardrobe, filtered through biases and the influence of media and the social scenes that we came to age in, to address a specific set of needs around environmental (rain, temperature), cultural (formality and clique), and personal conditions (mood, aspiration, functional exigencies).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But in other ways, it is incredibly liberating. It presents a daily opportunity for creativity, exploration, and novelty with the things that we already own, that are being created seasonally, or that others have left behind in the case of vintage. With all the cultural weight that goes into forging a particular piece of clothing — anatomy, cultural context, history, material requirements, cost requirements, style, and similar — there’s the daily opportunity for something new to emerge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite having that opportunity (and me more than many with my absurd jacket collection), why wasn’t I working that muscle? I felt there might be a hint in the three things that these text-based training plans were giving me: productive friction, a need for planning, and additive practice. So I’m doing an experiment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Getting Organized&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve thankfully had a fair bit of experience working across different tools for project management. Everything from spreadsheets to Basecamp to Trello to Podio were potential options. I’d been aware of Notion for a while (mostly via a constant stream of Medium posts about either going to Notion and never looking back, or leaving notion and looking back in sadness), and from the ambient knowledge I had about it suggested that it might be a good option.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While my understanding of what Notion could do was pretty loose, the core of it seemed to be relational databases (data referencing other datas) with a handful of configurable views into that data: from table to spreadsheet to graph. Without thinking about it too hard, this felt like a good starting point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think about how you structure a wardrobe. You have lots of different types of clothing, all of which fulfill usually one or two functions. They have different properties to them: some are warm, others are waterproof, some are both. Some are made of leather, others of synthetic fabrics, still others of cotton. Some are blue, others gray, others black (at least in my case). So one can broadly generalize “clothing” as something with properties that serves to shield some part of your body. Of course, there are other things. Shoes, accessories, bags, etc. We’ll get to that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In general though, an outfit ends up being some combination of those pieces of clothing, plus some of the other things. That combination is most fundamentally constrained by the cultural and physical environment, and what you have available. Then you get the next level down: constraints emerging from ones own taste and context — where did you learn to dress yourself? And then you get additional constraints emerging from the combinations with contrast, clashing, and complementary mixes coming up across variables of colour, fit, material, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, no system that I put together in an afternoon is going to replace a sense of style and intuition, but maybe I could make something that productively augments what I already have. So I set out to accomplish a few things:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Creative&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To visualize or summarize how a set of things might look together without “going searching”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To surface clothes not being worn so as to wear more pieces more consistently in combinations I hadn’t tried before&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To save the combinations I knew worked, and track the ones that don’t&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Practical&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To be able to “schedule” what I was going to wear in advance (i.e. put things out for the next day as part of my other evening responsibilities)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To track frequency of wears across the different pieces of clothes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To track what I need to repair, tailor, or clean more effectively.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding Notion as I did, I believed that the relationships would loosely look like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Item (with properties)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Several Collections of Items (Aggregation of properties)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Schedule of Collections (Record of Use)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I set out to implement it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Using Notion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Clothing&lt;/strong&gt;
Using Notion to realize the initial vision was simple. At its most basic, Notion’s data manifests as a table or text. I started by creating a list of as much as I could from memory (mostly jackets and sweaters), and then filling that into the spreadsheet. From there, I started to fill out the properties (i.e. columns) that made sense. Name, photo, tags, size, colour. Then more subjective things, like fit and potentially style: things that I could search by. This first part set up, I went full Mari Kondo on my closet, getting everything out and photographing the lot against a white(ish) background.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was the project of an afternoon, quietly accomplished during my son’s naps and an hour my wife was able to buy me. After I got everything in the database (all clothes, shoes, and bags anyway), I started to explore setting them up as separate views and creating the relational structure that would define the “outfit” idea.&lt;/p&gt;

The outfit is where things didn’t quite work as I wanted. Structurally, it’s relatively simple — just a matter of creating relationships to the different Clothing items. This ends up looking something like this, with a few variables that help with filtering and a photo for reference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this case, I would frame this part as the “Productive Friction” component. Before I was just collecting data and constraints, now this is combining these pieces into a greater whole that (hopefully) works out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though this solution is “good enough” for now, I can’t wait for Notion to develop an API to query these objects and relationships directly, or to programatically establish filters. Basically, my ideal would be to create a collection of items with tags, and then have those items laid out in a gallery so I could see them visually. As it stands, there’s still a bit too much friction. Additionally, the actual selection of a relationship is a bit cumbersome with the naming scheme that I developed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The manual way to do this is to create a view for a table, and then filter according to relationships. Unfortunately, since those filters can’t be assigned to a variable, the whole thing has to be done manually (as far as I know). The ideal would be to pass in a series of properties to the view that could manipulate the filter, but here we are.&lt;/p&gt;

Finally, actually making a day-to-day decision is tied to seeing those combinations and those other external needs. In other words, the need for planning. Filtering by the relevant constraint is the key here, organizing by one axis and filtering by another. I can take a look at the options and what I need for the day and make decisions on the margins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Calendaring is usable but a bit inefficient. This is an example of the past few days to test out this whole idea. Unfortunately, Notion lacks integration with Google calendar, so the calendar view itself ends up being quite limited.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What was useful (again, an API would be better) was filtering calendars by day, and then adding the view inline as shown below. This allows a trivial dashboard to be created, though again, it’s not particularly useful without a way to dig into the relations. The other frustrating piece is that these views seem to “reset” depending on other navigation you do within the database.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion&lt;/strong&gt;
Notion is a pretty impressive tool. It’s a great way to create content and build up something data-driven pretty quickly. Ultimately, it got me a lot further than I expected, but if the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.notion.so/Does-Notion-have-an-API-I-can-use-4541b07a5caa46dba0026624646118c0&quot;&gt;Notion public API wasn’t already a critical part of their roadmap&lt;/a&gt;, I would probably be trying to figure out how to export all this work and build a small custom solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;End of the day, a custom solution would be better, but as a catch all tool for personal organization or project management (eg. You can see in the screenshot that I’m also using Notion to plan and track these posts), I’m pretty happy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Getting to Outcomes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Technical details of how I’m approaching this aside, does it actually work?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m not sure yet. I’ve worn colours and individual pieces over the past few days which I haven’t touched in months. One pair of shoes had to be dusted off (though thankfully I’d taken good care of them previously). So only a few days in, I do feel like it is having an impact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My hope is to follow this pattern for a little while. This is where the additive practice part comes into play. A decade ago, I followed blogs like the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thesartorialist.com/&quot;&gt;The Sartorialist&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.facehunter.org/&quot;&gt;FaceHunter&lt;/a&gt;, but never understood quite how someone got from where I was to where some of the repeat subjects on those blogs found themselves. Now, I don’t feel that same need, but I do want to use what I have for the greatest utility and the greatest fun. In this case, it means the goal is to reduce my sense of decision fatigue and increase the variability and interest in what I wear. So I’ll practice. I’ll follow this post up in a few weeks or months with the outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Technical Innovation in Asymmetric Conflict]]></title><description><![CDATA[Security and Innovation are described as going hand-in-hand.

&lt;p&gt;Security and Innovation are described as going hand-in-hand. The logic is pretty simple: existential threats spur on unconventional allocation of resources towards R&amp;#x26;D to outpace the enemy at the national level, and lack of resources and necessity drives improvisation and innovation on the ground.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But how does it actually happen? In today’s asymmetric conflicts, we’ve seen terrifyingly effective innovations in IEDs, remote controlled weapons platforms, and conventional arms in the form of home-modified pickup trucks, drones with grenades, AK47 turrets controlled with a playstation controller, or even rudimentary autonomous weapons platforms. All of these platforms are nominally being developed to balance the scales in asymmetric conflict, but the question of who, why, and how this work is being developed hasn’t yet been approached systematically&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Overall Question&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In general, I want to explore how technical innovation is developed within small, clandestine, violent organizations, primarily looking at insurgencies and terrorist organizations (with all the definitional complexity there).
Broadly then, these are some of the questions I want to ask:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Considering armed guerilla groups and terrorist organizations, are there observable models of technical innovation that occur across groups?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are there consistent ways that technical and management problem solving emerges across orgs like AQI, the IRA, ISIS, the FSA, etc?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is there something inherent to the structure of these groups that produce a particular type of innovation?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What commonalities, advantages, and/or disadvantages do these models have when compared with models of innovation within conventional state-based war-fighting organizations?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How might such models might be compared?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Who are the catalysts and maintainers of these innovation cycles, and does this frame on value and innovation change our understanding of who catalyzes what in these organizations?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What kinds of traits to these individuals share with other innovators in the private sector, academia, and government?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why this Topic?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was surprised by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/z4mmve/people-are-still-killing-each-other-with-diy-weapons-in-syria&quot;&gt;the remote gun platforms&lt;/a&gt; coming out of Syria and ISIS-occupied Mosul in Iraq. I come from a self-taught engineering and development background: building music and artwork with electronics and software that ultimately turned into a career in innovation and design. Those same skills that I learned in workshops or self-taught online are being applied in conflict zones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In subsequent exploration, some of the techniques for building and sharing these creations felt a bit too familiar and I’m curious to dig deeper. My intent is to explore how and if there are consistent and observable ways that these innovations are created, disseminated, and scaled within and between organizations. One tangible example might the SVBIED factories that ISIS managed, and the way that &lt;a href=&quot;https://international-review.org/an-analysis-of-islamic-states-svbied-use-in-raqqa/&quot;&gt;the platforms evolved across the conflict and between cells&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason for approaching this as a masters thesis is two fold. First, it will hopefully let me leverage my professional experience to bring a different lens to the work, and do so in collaboration with my advisors. Second, I’m hoping to take two approaches to this: an empirical and a critical approach. I’ll talk about that later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why Me?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite a political science degree, I’ve worked for a decade in startups and innovation consulting. Working within both small and large organizations, I’ve tried to surface the interesting loops within human systems and to apply learning from systems thinking in what I build (eg. Donna Meadows, John Boyd, and more contemporary design thinking work). In this case, I want to do this research based off of the artifacts of the organizations instead of directly observing it as a consultant, employee, or ethnographer might. More broadly, I want to explore whether there is a certain inevitability in the innovation capacity of a business relative to its structure, and whether the same can be said the organizations I propose to study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Research Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope to leverage databases like &lt;a href=&quot;https://ctc.usma.edu/harmony-program/&quot;&gt;Westpoint’s Harmony DB&lt;/a&gt; (captured and translated management literature from terror orgs, especially AQI) and mimic some of the methodologies that Jacob Shapiro describes in &lt;a href=&quot;https://press.princeton.edu/books/hardcover/9780691157214/the-terrorists-dilemma&quot;&gt;The Terrorist’s Dilemma&lt;/a&gt;. I also find work by Erica Chenoweth to be incredibly inspiring, and have been closely reading her approaches. I plan on leveraging as much social media content from YouTube, twitter, reddit, etc. as possible to try and understand timelines of “innovation” moving across groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a starting point, I’m initially taking a look at an unclassified US Army report on remote and tele-operated weapons, the substantial reporting around these DIY weapons in Syria and Iraq, and forums like Reddit’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/shittytechnicals&quot;&gt;/r/ShittyTechnicals/&lt;/a&gt; (though I don’t know if Technicals count in this case). In addition, arms researchers like CalibreObscura and other OSINT-like researchers have used methodologies that might be borrowed and learned from. It is unlikely that I will do interviews with current/former combatants for a variety of reasons, both ethical and practical.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Critical Lens&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doing this research in the international security studies context and still following the post-structural framing we’ve been introduced to so far is a point of some anxiety. I’m committed to take as empirical an approach as I can to this work, but I think the analysis of bureaucratic data might highlight interesting details on the “who” involved in these innovations.
This raises some interesting questions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How do these innovations shift power relationships and who serves to drive those innovations forward?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Where are the inventors and makers coming from?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What kind of power do these makers hold within these organizations relative to others?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Wrapping Up&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All this said, I’m excited to do this work. While many are still living the conflicts that birthed these deadly creations, the past decades of multi-party asymmetric conflict have left a trove of media and data to be considered in understanding just how technical and management innovation emerge in organizations to weak to engage in conventional warfare. My hope is this work can serve to make some small contribution in highlighting mechanisms to interdict the worst of these innovations, especially those used in the targeting of non-combatants.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Reflecting on 2019]]></title><description><![CDATA[2019 has been a weird combination of my most exhausting, fulfilling, chaotic, and structured year to date.

&lt;p&gt;2019 has been a weird combination of my most exhausting, fulfilling, chaotic, and structured year to date. Midway through 2018, I decided that I wouldn’t share anything until it was “done”, or at least passed a significant milestone. So while I usually don’t write posts like this, this year felt worth the reflection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Four Changes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Four big life changes happened this year, mostly set up in 2018.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, and most importantly, my son Emil joined us. Writing this, he’s eight months and two weeks old. He’s trying to figure out how to stand, can put himself to sleep, and the teeth are attempting to come through.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, I created &lt;a href=&quot;https://knowsi.com&quot;&gt;Knowsi&lt;/a&gt;, a small SaaS business to manage informed consent in research. You can sign up for a free account if you use consent forms in your work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Third, I started a (part-time) graduate program in International Security Studies at the University of Leicester. This is mostly inspired by my experience at the New America fellowship and at the Pentagon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fourth, I survived the fall, where all three of these came together with my consulting practice. Initially that survival was mostly a function of an unequal workload between myself and my wife, so not exactly sustainable or fair.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Baby – Emil&lt;/h2&gt;

      /&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the summer of 2018, I was back in the US for a few weeks and had just walked out of my NREMT exam when I called Ayla to tell her I’d passed. On the topic of positive test results, she shared that she was pregnant and everything started to shift. The remainder of that year became one of preparing for something neither of us really understood: in our bodies; our identities; our relationship to work, to the world, to each other, and to the son we hadn’t yet met.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Emil showed up on April 10th, 2019 at our home in Frederiksberg. For all the classes and reading and discussions of the previous months, I wasn’t even close to prepared. Since he’s arrived, every week has been different and every week forces something new learned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With some planning and savings, I was able to take three plus months of paternity leave. In this whirlwind of diapers and family visits, I learned a bit about how caring for Emil manifested as action: changing a diaper, giving him a bath, checking if he’s warm enough, making sure he’s fed (the first few times the confused look he gave me was incredible), rewatching the baby heimlich on YouTube for the 12th time. Cumulatively these little acts have started to paint a picture of fatherhood for me that I want to build upon — parenthood as a craft. Any craft requires practice and introspection and that’s been (more than anything else) the past eight and a half months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, I think this means taking the quotidian parts of parenthood incredibly seriously. Little actions done frequently build up over time, and so those little actions will contribute to who he becomes. But as important are the intuitions acquired after doing something many, many times, and using those intuitions to deal with the unknown and the unpredictable. We’ll see how this theory of parenthood changes, but at least for now this is the model I’m working with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Product – Knowsi&lt;/h2&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://knowsi.com&quot;&gt;Knowsi&lt;/a&gt; emerged from a conviction that consulting as I had been doing likely wasn’t the right path forward. Coming off of an extended consulting project that had seen me back-and-forth from the UK and fairly burnt out, I had been collecting and exploring different ideas (and savings) for a small, bootstrappable Software-as-a-Service business. My theory: knowing that Emil was on his way, I wanted to have something that could bring in income and support a working lifestyle that would let me be present.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I settled on Knowsi from a host of other ideas while flying into Paris for New Years 2019. Consent management had always been a challenge in user research, with lost forms and disempowered participants. As a user researcher myself, I knew the problem well and had seen when it goes wrong. It was a discrete need, something that I was solving for myself, and was feasible with my skillset as an indie developer and designer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spent the next few months getting it off the ground, piloting it with the the Copenhagen Institute of Interaction Design, and rapidly turning it into something that worked, could be used, etc. When Emil was born, I took a few months off, and my diaper changing speed improved considerably . Unfortunately, Knowsi didn’t progress much in that time, but I got my first customer and it was a huge boost in morale. In the fall, Ayla and I did a complete redesign of the site and relaunched it, and from there have figured out a good pattern of collecting feedback (and responding quickly to bugs), setting priorities, and aggressively pushing on particular features through time-bound sprints.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than anything else though, I found that working on a business (vs a product) solo is maybe more trouble than its worth. While I can do most of the product work and some of the business, the constant focus switching is to to the detriment of the actual work. Also my marketing skills are useless. So in the new year, I intend to re-focus on Knowsi and seek collaboration and help from friends, colleagues, or people who share a similar excitement for qualitative research and privacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, I also just launched free subscription tier to support students and solo researchers in gathering and maintaining consent with their research participants. So if you’ve been curious about what I’ve been working on but didn’t want to put in a credit card, &lt;a href=&quot;https://knowsi.com/join&quot;&gt;now you can use Knowsi for free&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This has been a long time coming. I’ve flirted with graduate school for years. In 2012, I’d been accepted to NYU’s ITP program and almost moved to New York. However, after months of soul searching, I ended up saying no because didn’t want to be in that kind of debt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since then, I’ve had a lot of fun: starting two businesses, working at IDEO, at the Pentagon, being a think tank fellow, and currently living a slightly charmed independent consulting/product person’s life in Denmark. But every single year I start musing about returning to school, though that idea of what I would return FOR has shifted over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coming out of my Public Interest Tech fellowship with New America last year, I had started to explore working more deeply in issues surrounding the refugee crisis, climate change, and a more systemic view of security. Technology skills are great and useful, but I believe that to really be effective (and not harmful), I needed to shore up my knowledge of the issues and the critical discourse. So after many conversations, explorations, and books read, I landed on Security Studies as a field.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite my career in code and design, my academic roots are in political science, so I had (rusty) familiarity with the topic. I ended up reaching out to my former professor, Renan Levine. I actually hadn’t had particularly good grades in Professor Levine’s classes, but I reached out to him because he had a massive impact on my transition into design. Specifically, he taught me how to visualize my thinking, how to approach it systematically, and how to use externalized ideation as a lever for creativity. Weirdly, I believe what I learned in his research, policy, and statistics classes became my entryway into interaction design and entrepreneurship. And despite nearly a decade between his classes and my application, he wrote my recommendation letters that helped me get into a security studies MA in the UK. (So thank you Renan and Matt Cutts for the letters of recommendation!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I’ve just wrapped up the first term and starting to think about my dissertation. I have difficulty expressing how excited I am for the whole enterprise. Life would be a lot easier without this as I have to be incredibly structured in my time: I’m often up till two or three in the morning, and it has meant getting creative with the day-to-day of the household (which I’ll talk about next). But even a few months in I feel like what I’m learning is surfacing new areas to explore and a new way for me to understand the issues that I care about, but have struggled to act on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Problems — Survival&lt;/h2&gt;

      /&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, survival. This year has had a lot to do with privilege. My wife and I have benefited from the Danish child care policies. I had access to personal capital, skills, and time to start a small business. I had a network and the time to apply for a university. I had the network and skills to be selective in what I do work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite this, the past year has been the busiest in my life. Keeping up with friends and social engagements has been a struggle. Beyond even the normal limits to sleep that new parents face, to get everything done I’ve had an unhealthy number of nights with just four to six hours of sleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dealing with multiple responsibilities: Emil, working with Knowsi customers, consulting as a product manager with IKEA, leading design mentorship with the Innofounder accelerator program, and finally, acclimating to my grad program. When all of those came together in September, I managed to burn out in a few weeks and things weren’t working. I didn’t see failure as an option though, and I was able to figure out some new techniques for time management and tracking everything. It involved late nights, but nothing really slipped — or at least that’s what I initially thought.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this initial “balance”, I unfairly relied on my wife to pick up slack that I wasn’t seeing or was dramatically de-prioritizing. &lt;a href=&quot;https://slate.com/human-interest/2018/03/women-are-overburdened-with-their-families-mental-loads.html&quot;&gt;A weakness in our household dynamic that had existed previously at a lower level&lt;/a&gt; was suddenly becoming exacerbated by these new stressors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since that first month of chaos, we’ve been working together to figure out how to balance that better. Ayla and I have always used our skills as designers and managers to do the work of creating a good relationship and life together. So figuring out “okay, what does it mean to be equal NOW?” became a question that we were at least equipped to ask and start to figure out together. One tangible example worth mentioning is this (flawed but useful as a starting point) method in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/44071899-fair-play&quot;&gt;Fair Play&lt;/a&gt; book. As a way of visualizing the unseen tasks (an issue for me), it’s been effective. Given the speed at which Emil’s needs change, we have a standing meeting every week to figure out how our needs are changing alongside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, a willingness to share, visualize, and design the hard conversations by way of whiteboard, post-it, and through artifact goes a long way. If you’ve got a background in service design and facilitation, turning those skills on yourself and your relationships is incredibly worthwhile (albeit painful sometimes). If we hadn’t had these skills to begin with, I suspect we wouldn’t have been able to surface the need to have these conversations as quickly as we did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What Didn’t Work&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a few things this year that didn’t quite work out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As a &lt;strong&gt;consultant&lt;/strong&gt;, I (purposefully) brought in a lot less revenue than I normally do. I’m fortunate to be able to even make the decision to work less and make less, but still, it was a dip from previous years and I felt a fair bit of emotional stress even with it being intentional.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As a &lt;strong&gt;startup design mentor&lt;/strong&gt;, I dropped the ball this autumn. Despite successful workshops facilitated and some great reviews from my teams, I wasn’t nearly as present or available as I had been previously. Unfortunately, I’ve decided that this is the piece won’t get any better down the road, so I’ve decided to step back from leading the Design Mentorship at the Innofounder program.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As a &lt;strong&gt;friend&lt;/strong&gt;, I was never around. Part of this is a function of adult life for anyone, but I was conspicuously absent from group chats, drinks, parties, and general hangouts. Even when friends came to visit, I often had to truncate my time to work on an essay or deal with work. I haven’t figured out how to be better at this yet.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As an &lt;strong&gt;indie dev/founder/whatever&lt;/strong&gt;, I got distracted chasing shiny things a few times. For example, instead of focusing on Knowsi, I spent a few weeks building an MVP of a product called &lt;a href=&quot;https://fitfaj.com&quot;&gt;FitFaj&lt;/a&gt;, a customized training plan for expectant fathers. There are a few people using it actually, but I really should not have done this.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I started &lt;strong&gt;studying Arabic&lt;/strong&gt; in the Spring of 2019 after almost six months of trying to get into an Arabic language school in Copenhagen. I’d initially been studying Danish, and abandoned it when the state-supported language centres were defunded. I’ve also been studying pretty consistently with a tutor from &lt;a href=&quot;https://natakallam.com/&quot;&gt;Natakallam&lt;/a&gt;. However, I honestly don’t feel like I’ve gotten that far, and having just finished my most recent textbook, I’m struggling to figure out what the next step is. Regardless, the language itself is immensely interesting, and being able to read the script and understand some basics has me excited to figure out how to continue.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Things that Did Work&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nutrition&lt;/strong&gt; was a bit of the bass rhythm for this year. I think I would have struggled without it. I started following a keto diet in 2018, and am doing a keto-like thing with just low carbs (no one should be denied lentils and bananas). In general, the keto diet was ridiculous and I wouldn’t recommend it. It worked well for me, with the greatest payoff being consistent energy and no spikes of fatigue mid-day. On the negative, it meant my eating habits were incredibly inflexible, and if I didn’t get the right vitamin and electrolyte mix, I’d feel like I was dying. However, it set up a framework for me to do a less restrictive but still low carb diet incredibly easily, so it was an effective habit maker.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fitness&lt;/strong&gt; has been a bigger piece: I’ve been following a series of plans by the &lt;a href=&quot;https://mtntactical.com/&quot;&gt;Mountain Tactical Institute&lt;/a&gt; folk, and have really enjoyed them. I also got certified as a personal trainer (I use certifications to learn about things like this, also because of the FitFaj diversion). I don’t really follow my own plans (though have been making plans for others), but it has really helped make sense of the why and how of others’ plans, specifially the MTI ones. That knowledge has also motivated me to exercise with a consistency that I’ve never been able to keep before, about 6x a week.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Zeroing out my &lt;strong&gt;email&lt;/strong&gt; inbox is a obnoxious and terrible, but it’s been a primary technique for keeping on top of what’s coming in. Combined with a obsessive todo list keeping (I use Things3, but anything works, including paper), it has permitted an offloading and addressing of things in bite-sized chunks, and opened up more space for actually doing work. It’s far from perfect, but for whatever reason having unaddressed emails and tasks like that creates either avoidance or stress.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Acknowledging &lt;strong&gt;cycles&lt;/strong&gt;. This one was and is hard. I can work intensely and well in cycles, and then need to reset. This manifests as days of working quite passionately like a maniac, then needing a day or three of not doing really anything. When I fall out of these productive cycles, it manifests as my sleep schedule being out of whack, one of my core habits (like the inbox thing, or fitness) slipping, or feeling kind of anxious. This year, I feel like I finally got a handle on these cycles in a way that has made me a lot more effective.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Remote Work&lt;/strong&gt;. I cannot express how effective working remotely or semi-remotely is. I can be present with Emil, instead of commuting I can go to the gym, I get a massive amount more done, and the socializing and networking part of working becomes something that is more designed and less imposed. It requires noise canceling headphones and clear boundaries, but those headphones can be removed if you’re needed. It also requires a set of tools and technologies that really have to be tailored to each situation, and developed in collaboration with your team. Anyway, I hope to mostly work in remote or semi-remote context going forward, both to be around for Emil more, but also simply to get more done.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Going into 2020&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what does 2020 look like? Honestly, I don’t know yet, and to the point of my “don’t share until there’s a milestone” thing, I’ll share when it’s time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In general, Emil is starting at daycare in the new year,so I’m going to modify my &lt;a href=&quot;http://shop.larryvsharry.com/&quot;&gt;Bullitt bike&lt;/a&gt; for daily dropoff and figure out my sleep schedule. I’m continuing to work on Knowsi, and want to explore ways to put more time into it and my customers. I’m continuing to consult with IKEA, and work with a burgeoning team there that honestly, I can’t wait to share more about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beyond that though, we’ll see. In a week, this post itself went from “I need to write a reflection” to “I want to share that reflection” to “I need to make that blog finally” to “maybe I should just redo my site as a blog.” So… here we are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m going to be writing and posting more this year, plus there’s a maybe project with a friend from Toronto if you’re interested in international relations, politics, and design. So if you’re able, please subscribe to the update newsletter below!&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Reflecting on The Decay of Digital Things]]></title><description><![CDATA[We have spent a decade building the consumer Internet of Things with an ethos of “fail fast.” Unfortunately, many of the things we built…]]></description><link>https://log.andrewlb.com/decay/reflection/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://log.andrewlb.com/decay/reflection/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 05 Sep 2018 22:12:03 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;We have spent a decade building the consumer Internet of Things with an ethos of “fail fast.” Unfortunately, many of the things we built failed to embrace the withering effect that time has on business, technology, intention, and capital. Consumers have been left holding connected objects that no longer connect, and the question of why investments in the “future” of physical things have resulted in such ephemeral value. The Decay of Digital Things started as a series of personal essays and prototyping projects exploring this idea that turned into a class taught at the Stanford d.school in 2014. Inspired by my essays and a frustration about connected products with dead services, we asked the students to explore the different aspects of decay that are connected to networked objects. Physical metaphors like rust, patinas1, overgrowth, and repair were all central to the students’ construction of a body of work and scenarios that pointed to digital decay. Their work explored everything from the calcified information around our social networking identities, to the fragility inherent in creating a connected object; becoming a vanguard to uncritical enthusiasm for more that has become a hallmark of Silicon Valley-inspired creation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the beginning, this exploration emerged from my suddenly dead Little Printer. A brilliant little object from consultancy-turned-product company Berg, the Little Printer was a small Internet-connected thermal printer that could create all sorts of little artifacts, provided that they were two dimensional and monochromatic. This could be your to-do list for the day, a list of upcoming meetings to stuff into your wallet, an inspirational image, or your two-factor code. The printer got these messages by connecting wirelessly to a hub (tied to Berg’s plans for future connected things), which in turned connected to a server called Berg Cloud, which managed accounts, apps, and all the bits of software which brought the otherwise charming but simplistic object alive. On March 31st, 2015 though, this server and Berg as a business shut down, and a thoughtfully-designed piece of technology became so much dumb plastic and silicon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Berg’s story is one that has been repeated all over the connected world: ambitious companies create networked objects that bring more functionally than their un-networked kin. But with this functionality comes a compounding liability: infrastructure and the need for enduring business models that can maintain that infrastructure. Sometimes this is fine, but other times the cost becomes too much to bear. Of course, there are many different kinds of businesses in the world, and some of them are better able to support their connected products than others. A publicly-traded company like Garmin has multiple revenue streams and a complex web of telemetry-leveraging products. Many of these are Internet-enabled, and rely on an service called Garmin Connect and, more recently, a development platform called Connect IQ. This connectivity is a valued feature of the product, but not the product itself. The Garmin running&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;watch to track your run, or the cycling computer to track your route and fitness, and the marine GPS that tracks your boat. The fact that its features can be arbitrarily extended through an app store and connectivity is a value add, but ultimately not the product’s core purpose.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conversely, a company like Pebble, which shuttered its services in December 2016, had a much more challenging time.2 Pebble often kick started their product development on a product-by-product basis as it built a variety of wearable smart watches. They worked hard on their product, sold almost two million smart watches3, but ultimately weren’t able to make it work. The watches were generally well-made, had a strong application ecosystem, and are still loved by many of their owners. My friend Luke, an Australian postdoc in Copenhagen, still wears his Pebble every day. The watch is something he’s become accustomed to, bugs and all. He can flip through its menus quickly, and responds just as quickly to its little quirks: bugs that will ultimately never be fixed now that the platform has shut down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Software and Hardware&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Objects that require connectivity to deliver their promised value are ultimately just clients connecting to the endpoints of a broader service. It’s easy to argue that one is not buying the object itself, but rather access to the service that the object affords. On one level, this places the physical object on the same plane as any web application or mobile client that pulls data and context from a broader service. And certainly, for every dead Internet of Things startup on the battlefields of platform capitalism, there are dozens of dead software-only businesses. The demise of Rdio Inc. hit hard, as did the obsolescence of the Sparrow mail client as its team was acqui-hired to work on Google Inbox and saw Sparrow wither into uselessness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The death of a software product leaves a hole in one’s pocketbook and a need to find a functional cognate, but it doesn’t leave behind a corpse. Instead, if you think about our products as things that we hire or fire for their different capabilities, the analogy is closer to a hired feature (let’s say, our email client Sparrow) prematurely quitting, or simply disappearing one day. Certainly a shock, but with relatively little damage because we can find a substitute (such as the email client, Airmail). Conversely, when an Internet of Things service shutters its doors, the consumer and the environment are left to foot the bill of starting over. If your Internet of Things home security system shuts down because they botched their growth strategy, you have to invest in a new and expensive chunk of hardware for your home. Or, perhaps even worse, this product could be subject to an acquisition that locks the customer into a platform with values and a service model they don’t want, but can’t afford to change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Nature, Nurture&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have described a bleak view of connected objects, but fortunately this is not the only story worth telling. Even in the failed model, there are interesting early stabs at addressing the “long tail” of connected objects. One shockingly consistent example of sustainable product design is the Monome, a hardware platform for open source music creation that connects into an ecosystem of community-created tools. It’s a simple grid of lights and buttons that send and receive commands from a device. Mine is from 2008. I also recently set it up again to use with a new crop of tools from the Monome community, and its founder helped a community of us debug a problem with old monomes and a new OSX systems.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Monome presents a vision of sustainable product maintenance, because it is both a company and a community. Brian Crabtree created its first iteration, but countless others have written code for it, built performances around it, and made their own versions of it. It’s an open source product that creates greater value for its supporting business through the value generated within the community itself. Monome.org also has a vast repository of knowledge related to the monome in its different and evolving products that empowers its customers to continuously adapt it to their evolving needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Monome ethos of product development echoes the “slow company” movement exemplified by 37Signals and LDLN. Their theory is that what you are creating through your business is precious, and it’s very easy to ruin something by moving too fast. So don’t. Don’t take that investment if you’re not absolutely clear on how you’ll use it. Don’t commit yourself to that big Kickstarter campaign if you’ve only figured out the product, and not the production. The weight of capital can be a massive liability to an enterprise that is still figuring out how to walk unencumbered, let alone thrive under the weight of growth-forcing liabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Defibrillation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes though, things do simply fail. As frustrated as I am with Berg Cloud shutting down, it’s difficult to fault the Berg team in pursuing a dream and giving it their all. Sometimes businesses simply fail despite one’s best efforts. There might not be a market, or it might be a pricing strategy that doesn’t work, or you simply run out of runway. A business failure is not (necessarily) a moral failure on the part of the entrepreneurs, but the result is the same. Consumers are left with their dead plastics and silicon pining for a server that will answer back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Little Printer is an example of what can be done when a connected technology businesses does not foresee its own demise, but tries to react responsibly to it. Some simple searching reveals an enthusiastic community (along with the individual help of some former Berg team members), who have brought their now dead printers back to life. The process isn’t simple. It&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;involves setting up your own server and then flashing the Berg Hub to redirect server requests to the new address. These methods emerged from long githup discussions and thoughtful blog posts, but they emerged nonetheless. So why does the Berg device have a pathway to resuscitation while many other devices don’t?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think the answer lies in the community and in the approach of the product’s creators. The Monome platform and its subsequent creations started from a point of openness and community involvement. This gave the community a greater-than-normal stake in the outcomes of this product. Berg Cloud was a platform that spoke to creators and engaged consumers, so that when it closed, it had a larger pool of potential revivers to consider resuscitation. And because the Berg team released their server code and contributed to the discussion, the chance of reviving the Little Printer (at least on a small scale), is starting to become a reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the physical product world, aftermarket and Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) accessories emerge around any platform that sees some market success. This can have the effect of dramatically extending the life of these products as their creators disappear, but the demand remains. A few years ago, for example, I created a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:11815&quot;&gt;3D printable model for a table clamp&lt;/a&gt; that fit an old 1960s Luxo lamp. It’s since been downloaded close to a thousand times, hopefully extending the use of a wonderfull piece of design with otherwise difficult to find parts. We need to encourage a similar economy of repair, modification, and adaptation for our connected things, and I’d like to believe that the story of the Little Printer, initially tragic, might point to a more optimistic future for our decaying digital things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Better to Fade Away&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Four years after the Decay of Digital Things class, I’ve become a bit inured to this crisis of sustainability for these products. All around us, we’re seeing an accretion of hollowed-out objects calling for servers long since shuttered. The brilliant &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/internetofshit&quot;&gt;Internet of Shit&lt;/a&gt; twitter account provides a near-daily laugh track of poorly considered connected things. My friend Luke wears one on his wrist as a simple watch, shrugging off its lost functionality with the insistence that it had a “good run.” I have another on my shelf as a multifaceted totem to my values as a designer: its brand –a smiling face left after each new print– now barely visible on the sun-weathered thermal paper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are creating software-powered things in an environment that often requires businesses to pursue capital intensive growth models if they want to be considered successful. But this is far from the only path, and we need more diverse definitions of success if we’re going to deflect the distracting, wasteful, anxious, closed, bricked, unfixable, expensive, disenfranchised future that the first decade of the Internet of Things seems to promise&lt;/p&gt;

      /&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Computers are ecosystem. Tiny unix programs support the workings of massive GUI-based applications, hidden processes spin in tandem to create useful (or useless) heat and information, and deeply buried systems check from time-to-time to return computers to some factory-defined state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But since we created these artificial jungles of transistors and computation, we’ve also had the virus. Slipping across networks and self-replicating within systems, computer viruses are at one time a stunning example of engineering virtuosity, and a stark reminder of the strengths and weaknesses of the network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My suspicion is that the computer virus, despite being a product of human creativity like all computational things, is a natural and perhaps necessary part of the networked computational ecosystem. Viruses slow down processes, corrupt data, can cause physical damage (as in the case of &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20190612065150/http://www.wired.com/2011/07/how-digital-detectives-deciphered-stuxnet/all/&quot;&gt;w32.Stuxnet&lt;/a&gt; ), and persist in PRAM and bios chips long after one might think they have started from a blank slate. They can cross ecological boundaries, as in the case of stuxnet’s USB jumping or in the 2006 case of &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20190612065150/http://www.apple.com/support/windowsvirus/&quot;&gt;Apple iPods accidentally shipping with a windows viruses&lt;/a&gt; . They grow more resilient, such as a virus being enabled in the fight against the personal computer’s leucocytes. Viruses enabled with polymorphic or metamorphic engines are set up to obfuscate the lens of anti-virus software, enabling a broader spread and slower meaningful response on the part of those who craft these defenses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even with these analogies to the natural world though, the computer virus is a conscious creation on the part of an individual or organization. Something released into the world in order to accomplish a task, to execute some mischief, or to forward to malicious intent. With this frame, how can the virus be something both natural and valuable in a networked and constructed ecosystem?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Viralmimicracy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to explore two very small things: viruses and bacteria. Viruses operate by infecting a host and taking over its mechanisms for reproduction and other purposes. This process can kill the host, or damage them, but often benefit the host through greater overall resilience and other emergent qualities from contact with the viral infection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In contrast, bacteria are single-celled organisms that thrive in different organic environments, causing a range of effects in the same. For example, bacteria serves as a primary mechanism for enabling decay in biological systems, the same bacteria that help us digest food.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Contemporary human craft often rebels against the notion that these qualities might be positive. In physical products, decay can be manifest through material degradation or obsolescence: the cultural context for the object has shifted. In computational systems, decay is often manifest through informational entropy: the value of information changing, becoming lost, becoming unsearchable, or losings its connection to its network and its context. In most cases, the effect is almost entirely deleterious to the host.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what happens when we try to create beneficial viruses (which is where I’m going with all of this)? In the mid-90s, there was a hidden battle (of sorts) propagated across millions of systems worldwide. The BLAST virus and the Welchia worm were two viruses with different intentions. &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20190612065150/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blaster_(computer_worm)&quot;&gt;Blast (w32/Lovesan.worm)&lt;/a&gt; was a malicious virus that infected windows systems through window’s insecure remote system mechanism, but &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20190612065150/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welchia&quot;&gt;Welchia was different&lt;/a&gt; . Welchia infected systems through the same mechanism, but its payload to be released on successful infection was a series of beneficial Windows software patches. It also fixed the mechanism its entrance mechanism and self deleted after a time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite this good intent, Welchia was a big program for a lot of people: messing up system configurations, tying up network traffic, and restarting systems once its well meaning payload was installed. One can’t help but wonder then: is a beneficial virus possible? Or might we use the self-replicating and invasive qualities of the virus as a template for what might be a natural component to the lifecycle of a system? Perhaps we can understand such thing to to serve some of the roles that bacteria hold in living systems: healthy decay, build resilience in the host against the environment, and a partner to their hosts’ core functions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Computational Bacteria&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wonder how a viralmimicracy movement in computer science and systems design might emerge? Perhaps we might develop applications and operating systems that were susceptible to viruses, if only to combat the glut of legacy systems emerging with cheaper computation and greater access. Perhaps this becomes more aggressive: application being shipped infected and ready to infect, doing harm to the competitors and setting up an environment habitable to the new application. Perhaps we might do as Stuxnet: target the specific problems by blanketing networks of generalized machines? (This seems a recipe for disaster)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s explore computational bacteria. Might we shift away from the modern monolithic application environment; returning to the earlier days of command-line programs and piped (|) information transfer. An application is no longer a single thing, but a fog of information, computation, and modular utility. Could a network of computers pass good health and maintenance practices to each other, making everyone stronger as a result? Viral in their capacity to spread, but bacterial in their neutrality, emergent utility, and otherwise banal qualities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With that in mind, I created a small bacteria. &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20190612065150/https://github.com/readywater/osx-mom&quot;&gt;“OSX/mom”&lt;/a&gt; will make sure things don’t get too messy around here, but might frustrate you a bit in the process. A simple C program that is fired manually and does a little cleanup right now, but it might be fired by launchd or exist as &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20190612065150/https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/MacOSX/Conceptual/BPSystemStartup/Chapters/DesigningDaemons.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/10000172i-SW4-SW9&quot;&gt;an XPC service in the OSX environment&lt;/a&gt; . It might be bundled with other tools tied to the intent of better system management: memory cleans, disk space watchers, etc. It might be one amongst hundred, thousands of tiny programs: piping data into each other, serving little functions, and making your computer, your network, your computational ecosystem just a little bit stronger every day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20190612065150/http://decay.io/&quot;&gt;The Decay of Digital Things&lt;/a&gt; started life as a series of essays exploring the role that time and decay play in networked objects. What happens when the networks and businesses that support connected devices shut their doors? How do we design for both our users’ death, and the death of the system? It was a plea for designers and developers of digital things to take responsibility for the role their creations have in time. I set out to explore this space through essays and some artistic explorations, but wanted to find an opportunity to bring more people into the conversation around the topic. Being (incredibly) new to San Francisco though, I was at a bit of a loss as to how.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While exploring this project, it was suggested to me by a colleague at &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20190612065150/https://www.ideo.com/&quot;&gt;IDEO&lt;/a&gt; that perhaps this topic could be explored at Stanford’s Hasso Plattner Institute of Design, also known as the &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20190612065150/http://dschool.stanford.edu/&quot;&gt;d.school&lt;/a&gt; . The d.school was founded in 2004 by IDEO’s founder, &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20190612065150/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_M._Kelley&quot;&gt;David Kelly&lt;/a&gt; , and has since become a major port of calling for students of many disciplines at Stanford (and elsewhere) who are looking to approach cross-disciplinary problems using the tools and framing of design practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The d.school offers a “popup” class format that allows faculty and d.school fellows to propose new class designs outside of the standard curriculum offered by the d.school and other faculties, but instead explore new topics in non-traditional formats. A call for these popups goes out to the d.school fellow/faculty community every few months, and range from highly structured, credit-based courses that factor into existing curriculum, to somewhat gonzo uncredited classes, to somewhere in-between. Popup classes are presented to the student body during the “Popup Fair,” which sees the different popup classes vying for student attention and signup. The quality of the pitch and the survival of the classes dependent on how many students you can pull in. It was pretty exciting, so upon learning all this, I jumped at the chance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, the creation of the Decay of Digital Things popup class at Stanford took three broad arcs: Negotiating the d.school as an outsider, Collaboration with my co-teachers to design the curriculum, and working with the students to create outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Negotiation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In pitching the class to the d.school, I was given a fairly key constraint: I was required to find a co-teacher from the d.school itself. For the d.school, this serves as a layer of defence against mismatches in subject matter and method. Admittedly, I had an easier time gaining access to the d.school as an IDEO employee, but lacking that layer of connection with a d.school faculty member, the class would have likely fallen short.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a few cold calls from the faculty site, I was eventually introduced to &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20190612065150/http://dschool.stanford.edu/bio/maryanna-rogers/&quot;&gt;Maryanna Rogers&lt;/a&gt; , a graduate of Stanford herself and a teacher at the d.school who was interested in speculative design angle of the class. Once Maryanna was brought into the thesis of the class and was interested in moving forward, she was able to help me navigate the approval process for the class, and we got it on the roster for the coming semester.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Collaboration&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next step was to start designing the class itself. What did we want out of it? How did we want our students to grow? What kind of outcomes fit both the theme, and the frame of speculative design?
While thinking this through, we decided to reach out to a third co-teacher, &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20190612065150/http://www.confectious.net/about-me/&quot;&gt;Liz Goodman&lt;/a&gt; , who’s a thinker on design practice and connected objects. One of the first things we explored was wanting some form of tangible outcome: something fitting to the design backgrounds of the teachers, as well as the need to push folk towards translating idea or provocation into tangible object.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We started looking for a gallery space where we could host the students, and eventually found one in &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20190612065150/http://workshopresidence.com/&quot;&gt;Workshop Residence&lt;/a&gt; , a gallery and craft space in San Francisco. Despite not knowing how many students we might get, what their skillsets might be, and how they might engage with the class, we had resolved at least to ask them to create something tangible and physical to articulate an otherwise abstract idea about time and digital materialism. This desire on our part to challenge the students became a strong asset for the class going into it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Co-creation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Going into the course, we had designed the class time to be focused around co-creation and fast prototyping of concepts as a route to understanding. We had created a small digital card game (playable at &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20190612065150/http://cards.decay.io/&quot;&gt;http://cards.decay.io&lt;/a&gt; ) to help students brainstorm scenarios for their final project, which would be displayed in the gallery. By playing the card game, we found the students were able to much more quickly connect the abstractions underpinning the class to events or situations in their own life, and in turn helped them rapidly come up with ideas for the final work for the gallery show. The added benefit was that the students helped challenge our understanding of the class and subject matter as well. While we had initially been very focused around IoT enabled objects, for example, several of the students focused heavily on the notion of “decay” within social networks, and how to celebrate or cope in situations of lost love or death. On an opposite vein, one of our students (who now teaches at the d.school) explored the role that ritual might play around objects with “intelligence,” and how we might be emotionally affected by the death of an object that was also our companion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The class ended on a very strong note, with the students rising to the challenge of creating a series of individual and team-based installation pieces that were showcased at the Workshop Residence gallery. The popup format at the d.school gave me an incredible opportunity to glimpse inside, learn from, and contribute to an institution that otherwise can be pretty difficult to parse. Popup classes are a fascinating and accessible form of low-risk experimentation for schools. Especially in design programs where prototyping is the word of the day, having an accessible way to prototype new subjects and teaching methods goes a long way.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Haunted Machines]]></title><description><![CDATA[The world keeps tabs on us.

    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The world keeps tabs on us. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20190612065150/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0w36GAyZIA&quot;&gt;recent revelations about the NSA and other organizations&lt;/a&gt; reinforced the impressive scale of this tracking, and show the contrast between modern techniques and those of the past. The expiration date on a driver’s license is a tool for biometrics. Registering to vote is a mechanism for observation. But now, we are so much better at it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to explore whether these systems can rot from within. One of the most lauded qualities of software is its ability to be “upgraded”, often without physical change. New software is written, drivers are updated, techniques are refined, etc. But the reality is one of legacy systems holding a controlling interest on our interactions: old infrastructure running outdated software designed for calcified human systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What happens when our new software – with massive databases and sophisticated learning models – are left for ten, twenty, thirty years or more? Core to the human experience is that we grow and learn while having only limited foresight into our future state. What if we asked the same of computational systems?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A human baby learns to recognize faces early, and there is some debate as to whether facial recognition is hard-wired into the human brain, or &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20190612065150/http://www.psy.vanderbilt.edu/faculty/gauthier/FoG/Greebles&quot;&gt;something that’s entirely learned&lt;/a&gt; . In either case, our ability to recognize faces means understanding key physical form (that a nose goes here and not there), understanding how these forms are abstracted across categories (this is a human nose and &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20190612065150/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4J_FFvh_0aQ&quot;&gt;not a Llama nose&lt;/a&gt; ), and tying meaning to specific members of that category based on unique traits (your nose is different from my mother’s nose, so you can’t be my mother). These abilities make us highly specialized systems for understanding and reacting to the state of other human beings, and form some of the underlying mechanisms for navigating community, others’ emotions, and relationships.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Computers are not as good at this. A specially-configured computer might recognize a human face in an image, or a differently configured one might recognize – or even learn to recognize – a number of specific faces, but neither approaches the kind of adaptable specialization that humans demonstrate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Implicit in the language of &lt;strong&gt;configuration&lt;/strong&gt; is a kind of permanence that &lt;strong&gt;learning&lt;/strong&gt; navigates around. The human condition is one of constant, often monumental, change that manifests itself in countless external and internal ways. A computer might be configured to &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20190612065150/http://people.uncw.edu/ricanekk/teaching/spring09/csc100/lectures/pattersone/ComparisonOfSyntheticFaceAging.pdf&quot;&gt;interpret the world like a professional forensics artists&lt;/a&gt; , for example, and project how &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20190612065150/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_(Computer_vision)&quot;&gt;features&lt;/a&gt; might change over time, but it would be ill-suited to speculating on the details of that change, and likely not even considered for that task. I wonder if we can truly build computers that can grow along with us, even if we configure them with those core capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Paranoid Computers in a Haunted World0&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I suspect that “learning” can be a kind of decay within a system. Learning might manifest itself through unexpected behaviour that drifts from a configured state, as if by &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20190612065150/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_reckoning&quot;&gt;dead reckoning&lt;/a&gt; . Just as an analog synthesizer needs to be adjusted like the instrument that it is, maybe the learning machine can drift out of tune through its own functionality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s imagine a system that could learn to interact on a pseudo-emotional level, had a database for remembering people, and could improve its interactions by “learning” from each encounter with a user. This system tries to identify visually, interprets an emotional response, self-corrects, and tries again. Like a person, it learns by re-configuring based on experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s say it’s a concierge system for a condo parking lot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what if it was mostly unable to recognize faces like it was designed to: its lens is distorted, or maybe its image processor is poorly coded. Maybe’s it’s simply old. This distortion causes that computer to collect false, or semi-formed experiences. A series of cameras in a parking lot – now a normal thing – algorithmically squint at detected movement, trying to make sense of the known and the unknown. The sun sets, its lens flares, and suddenly everyone looks like that one visitor two weeks ago who was allowed in that time, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How would that computer – confused and confronted by aggressive users reacting to false negatives – reconfigure itself, and react to its inability to make sense of the world it was configured for, but can’t quite see. By trying to absorb a context based on a skewed understanding of the world, the computer is experiencing a kind of decay. It slowly drifts away from its original configuration and inadvertently finds itself in a state of obsolescence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I find myself feeling a weird empathy for these kinds of machines. It’s an empathy for a simple thing caught unawares, almost like &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20190612065150/http://www.technovelgy.com/ct/content.asp?Bnum=987&quot;&gt;Charlie Stross’ semi-sentient Lobsters&lt;/a&gt; serving as confused artificial intelligence models for the human-centered internet. There is no easy solution for legacy software and systems. So how do we deal with them?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe we exist with old systems the way that we will (hopefully) exist with our aging human population: with respect and inclusivity. An aged facial recognition system might be bolstered by proximity, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20190612065150/http://www.kinecteducation.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Screen-shot-2011-05-19-at-5.21.32-PM.png&quot;&gt;new media pose&lt;/a&gt; , or a patient pause of ones facial expression. Or perhaps its &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20190612065150/https://vimeo.com/48204264&quot;&gt;understanding that some names need to be spelled phonetically or pronounced as such.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bruce Sterling suggested our future is one of &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20190612065150/http://www.well.com/conf/inkwell.vue/topics/430/Bruce-Sterling-and-Jon-Lebkowsky-page01.html&quot;&gt;“old people in big cities who are afraid of the sky.”&lt;/a&gt; I think this prediction might be applied to old cities with too many people that struggle for purpose, as well. As we continue to grapple with the challenges of legacy systems and their moldering infrastrcuture, perhaps we ought to also develop a practice of patient interaction design to deal with this future gracefully on both fronts.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Sensor Ghosts]]></title><description><![CDATA[In high school, a friend once told me that a pair of sneakers hanging from a power line marked a place where drugs were sold.

    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In high school, a friend once told me that a pair of sneakers hanging from a power line marked a place where drugs were sold. I later found out that this (mostly) wasn’t the case, but I still notice them dangling in the wind, as though they had meaning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lately, our shoes have become a vector for reading our behaviours. Tools like Nike+ currently exist as small sensor pods that attach to our shoes and talk to our phones, but in proposals and patent drawings, a future is being sketched that describes washable computers and fabric-like sensors, seeing these once detachable objects embedded directly into our clothing. And like any other fashion, if it wears out in style or in structure, it is discarded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The MIT Senseable City Lab explored the strange life of the discarded with their project &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20190612065150/http://senseable.mit.edu/trashtrack/&quot;&gt;Trash|Track&lt;/a&gt; . For this project, the lab designed a circuit called &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20190612065150/http://senseable.mit.edu/trashtrack/how-it-works.php?id=3&quot;&gt;Trash Tag&lt;/a&gt; to be embedded in the refuse – including an old shoe – which worked by responding to movement and broadcasting a cellular signal to local towers. This signal was triangulated by the service providers, and sent back to the lab for analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m wondering what the “fully embedded” future might look like, versus one that needs to be attached. If the seams of a piece of clothing can be &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20190612065150/http://researchnews.osu.edu/archive/antclothpix.htm&quot;&gt;designed as an antenna&lt;/a&gt; , then anything from a shirt or a shoe can be made to record and report. Presumably this will be in no way nefarious: these sensor-clothes will analyze our posture, or track how many calories we’ve burned today. They’ll measure heart rates, buzz when they detect an open Wifi system, or change shape depending on the temperature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The electronics sewn into our clothes will be cheap, might be powered by Microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) or inductive laundry baskets, and will be utterly discardable like our clothing is now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Recycle lost sensor networks&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what happens after a wearable is discarded?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my neighbourhood, there are a fair number of forgotten shoes jostling each other from their wirey perch. Since starting to think about this project, I’ve been wondering if they could talk to each other, or teach us something from their vantage point, were they suitably enabled with software and sensors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What if the networked waste we’re creating continues to broadcast into the ether? What if their MEMS-enabled batteries and ultra low powered processors doing what they were designed to do: reporting on location, or movement, or localized heat, or brightness. They might send that data to a networked server, or ping helplessly for a phone or router they think is nearby.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to think about recycling digital things as not just reusing their components, but by recycling or upcycling their purpose. I’m wondering if there’s some way to turn the detritus of our vogues and narcism into a localized story. Maybe we could create a beacon for these discarded smart things: giving dead wearables a new life through access, organization, and transparency. A cheap computer, some clever routing, and a community catalogue of wireless protocols and APIs might be all we need to turn once private products into a localized and public sensor network. Like a digital version of Jane Jacob’s eyes on the street, these discarded smart things just might teach us something incredible.

    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I make things. A restlessness sets in when I’m not using my body to manipulate some tool – be it a computer, a kitchen knife, or my bicycle. And I’m far from alone in this compulsion. What I hadn’t expected was to share this compulsion with machines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Machines like the &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20190612065150/http://bergcloud.com/littleprinter/&quot;&gt;BERG Little Printer&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20190612065150/http://www.makerbot.com/&quot;&gt;Makerbot&lt;/a&gt; genus share this compulsion, and project their compulsion on us. More than any other type of tool, they evoke a style of creation that is specific to their nature, instead of complementary to ours. This makes it easy to get started within the frame they create. Whether by API or CAD, these tools are made to make, and we become their managers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Constructor&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Little Printer is a powerful case study in managed creation, or “instancing.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Little Printer emerged from &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20190612065150/http://berglondon.com/blog/2006/10/06/my-printer-my-social-letterbox/&quot;&gt;the theory of a Social Printer as articulated by Matt Webb&lt;/a&gt; , suggesting that the printer itself isn’t what’s valuable, but rather the appearance of an artefact tied to my tribe. The mail suddenly becomes mediated by the mailbox, and the mailbox’s role is to describe and manage the mail. The mail becomes an instance of the mailbox.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You subscribe to a variety of feeds via Berg’s web app, and from that point on, your Little Printer will print out the contents of that feed according to when you’ve scheduled it. The printer uses Thermal Paper, which has information printed on its specially-treated surface by a heated printer head. Berg points out that they use recycled and &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20190612065150/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bisphenol_A&quot;&gt;BPA free&lt;/a&gt; thermal paper, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20190612065150/http://bergcloud.com/help/#printing-and-paper&quot;&gt;they’ve made clear efforts to be environmentally conscious&lt;/a&gt; .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;~Destructor&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The question is what happens after the printing. There is no &lt;em&gt;method&lt;/em&gt; to remove this instance from the world. The Little Printer is a thing that creates without giving an option to destroy the creation when its usefullness is over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I want is a Little Printer with a &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20190612065150/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Destructor_(computer_programming)&quot;&gt;Destructor Function&lt;/a&gt; . I want the Little Printer to take responsibility for its waste – not burden me with it. Just as well-written software cleans up after itself by freeing the memory it was using on my computer, I want the well-designed Making Machine to clean up after its mess.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So let’s start with the quintessential “Bad Idea.” I present to you, &lt;em&gt;Little Printer: self powered edition&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

What happens when things are capable of navigating their lifespans? I wonder what those things would be like.
Would they be buildings that pay their own property taxes with their energy savings?
Or smartphones that knew where their recycling plant lived, and guessed at when they would arrive there? What if that recycling plant knew when to expect them?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Decay&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the biological world, Decay is a physical phenomenon where materials become a simpler form of material and energy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But in the culture of making objects, &lt;em&gt;decay is a multidimensional problem&lt;/em&gt;. The physical decay of an object fails to sync up to the behavioural, cultural, or digital decay of that thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Decay becomes the natural output of an ecosystem of use, disuse, and obsolescence not dictated by material, but by software and consumer expectation from software behaviour. This decay is taking the form of obsolescence and apathy: a world of forgotten things with short lifespans and nowhere to go afterwards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The danger is that culture rot is claiming the utility of objects before material rot ever does, and the physical casings that held the once functional circuits and software can take an eternity to decay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To combat this, decay must be reframed as inherent to the value of an object. This can be done by situating time as something that adds value (or detracts by its absence), and by challenging the emerging anonymity and replaceability of network connected objects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We want to enable a graceful ecosystem of creation, decay, and rebirth in a software-infested and thing-saturated world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Viridian Inspiration&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I suspect that designing for decay means designing Viridian things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1998, Bruce Sterling set out on a decade long journey called the &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20190612065150/http://www.viridiandesign.org/&quot;&gt;Viridian Design Movement&lt;/a&gt; . One of its many goals was to address the failures in the communication design of existing environmentalist movements, and to develop an interface for designers to become not green, but Viridian (i.e. effective).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His 2005 book, &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20190612065150/http://www.amazon.com/Shaping-Things-Mediaworks-Pamphlets-Sterling/dp/0262693267&quot;&gt;Shaping Things&lt;/a&gt; , synthesized much of the Viridian movement into a manifesto reminiscent of Machiavelli’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20190612065150/http://www.constitution.org/mac/prince00.htm&quot;&gt;The Prince&lt;/a&gt; . Razor focused in its intentions, accessible, and action oriented; Shaping Things gives its (possibly unwitting) readers a toolkit for parsing the past and present through Viridian goggles. For designers in particular, this means changing the way we make decisions for our world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Viridian things are shaped by &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20190612065150/http://www.viridiandesign.org/principles.html&quot;&gt;many principles&lt;/a&gt; , and I’ve come to focus on two in particular:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Avoid the Timeless, Embrace Decay”&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;“Planned Evanescence”&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A third principle, &lt;strong&gt;“Be When You Are”&lt;/strong&gt;, serves to ground this exploration. I’ll explore decay through the lens of computationally-enabled things and contemporary technology: a subset of “Gizmo” culture that Sterling references in Shaping Things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m looking forward to this journey with you.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
