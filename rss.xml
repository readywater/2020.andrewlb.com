I have an affinity for jackets and bags. The two central functions to protect and to carry somehow stand out in my mind as being what this whole clothing endeavour is about. In the quest for a more perfect bag and a more perfect jacket, I’ve tried many form factors and materials. However, somewhere along the line this search evolved into more of a collection than a solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taking stock of this jackets collection, I realized that many hadn’t been worn in some time and the same could be said for the rest of my wardrobe. I have my most comfortable quotidian wears, but a lot of the clothing that had inspired me up to the point of acquisition wasn’t being used according to that aspiration or inspiration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further, despite my attempts at the Marie Kondo approach (which definitely works), I’d hit a point of diminishing return. I really like the clothes that I have, though I suffer a bit from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.telegraph.co.uk/men/fashion-and-style/11432284/Blokewear-the-clothes-men-love-that-women-hate.html&quot;&gt;Blokewear&lt;/a&gt; thing between Engineered Garments’s infinity pockets and Acronym nerdy functionality. They fit an acquired, developed, or aspired style most times; they were mostly of a quality that was worth preserving and repairing vs. replacing; and sometimes there was even an emotional connection or story tied to them. So another option was needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A More Perfect Closet&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The digital closet is a trope that I’ve seen quite a bit from the tangible interface/new media world, not to mention the genius that is &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/XNDubWJU0aU&quot;&gt;Clueless&lt;/a&gt;. What if computers could help us look good with what we have (though software business models being what they are, our wardrobes would likely balloon), and make the inferences and connections between different pieces of clothing for us. No need for colour coordinating, fit experiments, or quotidian creativity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/92f371cb4ab7338a6afabd67f16a8d6a/clueless.gif&quot; alt=&quot;Clueless Wardrobe&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Elsewhere in my life, I’d been using different tools that “automated” the creative and planning side of personal fitness. Strava and TrainingPeaks both have scaling training plans that tie into your phone and your Garmin, effectually offloading the responsibility to plan and personalize. But I’ve come to believe this was creating an intellectual weakness in how I approached maintaining the body. When a training plan ended, or if I got knocked off it somehow by work, a cold, or travel, the return to that curated path felt unnatural. Despite the exhaustive metrics surrounding me, I didn’t know how I got there, so I didn’t know how (or why) to continue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More recently, I’ve been using plans from the MT Institute, which just come as a weekly list of “Do this.” There’s no tracking or technical sophistication: their app is basically just a text document with a password with a few links to youtube videoes for how to do certain exercises. It was infuriating at first. But because of that friction, it has forced a planning and engagement with my fitness that I haven’t had in years. Somewhat naturally by extension, I started to learn the how and why of getting somewhere and keeping going.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This relates to my wardrobe because the fabric we wrap ourselves in serves to work a kind of daily muscle. In some ways, we are incredibly constrained. We have a limited wardrobe, filtered through biases and the influence of media and the social scenes that we came to age in, to address a specific set of needs around environmental (rain, temperature), cultural (formality and clique), and personal conditions (mood, aspiration, functional exigencies).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But in other ways, it is incredibly liberating. It presents a daily opportunity for creativity, exploration, and novelty with the things that we already own, that are being created seasonally, or that others have left behind in the case of vintage. With all the cultural weight that goes into forging a particular piece of clothing — anatomy, cultural context, history, material requirements, cost requirements, style, and similar — there’s the daily opportunity for something new to emerge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite having that opportunity (and me more than many with my absurd jacket collection), why wasn’t I working that muscle? I felt there might be a hint in the three things that these text-based training plans were giving me: productive friction, a need for planning, and additive practice. So I’m doing an experiment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Getting Organized&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve thankfully had a fair bit of experience working across different tools for project management. Everything from spreadsheets to Basecamp to Trello to Podio were potential options. I’d been aware of Notion for a while (mostly via a constant stream of Medium posts about either going to Notion and never looking back, or leaving notion and looking back in sadness), and from the ambient knowledge I had about it suggested that it might be a good option.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While my understanding of what Notion could do was pretty loose, the core of it seemed to be relational databases (data referencing other datas) with a handful of configurable views into that data: from table to spreadsheet to graph. Without thinking about it too hard, this felt like a good starting point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think about how you structure a wardrobe. You have lots of different types of clothing, all of which fulfill usually one or two functions. They have different properties to them: some are warm, others are waterproof, some are both. Some are made of leather, others of synthetic fabrics, still others of cotton. Some are blue, others gray, others black (at least in my case). So one can broadly generalize “clothing” as something with properties that serves to shield some part of your body. Of course, there are other things. Shoes, accessories, bags, etc. We’ll get to that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In general though, an outfit ends up being some combination of those pieces of clothing, plus some of the other things. That combination is most fundamentally constrained by the cultural and physical environment, and what you have available. Then you get the next level down: constraints emerging from ones own taste and context — where did you learn to dress yourself? And then you get additional constraints emerging from the combinations with contrast, clashing, and complementary mixes coming up across variables of colour, fit, material, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, no system that I put together in an afternoon is going to replace a sense of style and intuition, but maybe I could make something that productively augments what I already have. So I set out to accomplish a few things:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Creative&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To visualize or summarize how a set of things might look together without “going searching”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To surface clothes not being worn so as to wear more pieces more consistently in combinations I hadn’t tried before&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To save the combinations I knew worked, and track the ones that don’t&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Practical&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To be able to “schedule” what I was going to wear in advance (i.e. put things out for the next day as part of my other evening responsibilities)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To track frequency of wears across the different pieces of clothes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To track what I need to repair, tailor, or clean more effectively.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding Notion as I did, I believed that the relationships would loosely look like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Item (with properties)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Several Collections of Items (Aggregation of properties)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Schedule of Collections (Record of Use)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I set out to implement it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Using Notion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Clothing&lt;/strong&gt;
Using Notion to realize the initial vision was simple. At its most basic, Notion’s data manifests as a table or text. I started by creating a list of as much as I could from memory (mostly jackets and sweaters), and then filling that into the spreadsheet. From there, I started to fill out the properties (i.e. columns) that made sense. Name, photo, tags, size, colour. Then more subjective things, like fit and potentially style: things that I could search by. This first part set up, I went full Mari Kondo on my closet, getting everything out and photographing the lot against a white(ish) background.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was the project of an afternoon, quietly accomplished during my son’s naps and an hour my wife was able to buy me. After I got everything in the database (all clothes, shoes, and bags anyway), I started to explore setting them up as separate views and creating the relational structure that would define the “outfit” idea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Outfit&lt;/strong&gt;
The outfit is where things didn’t quite work as I wanted. Structurally, it’s relatively simple — just a matter of creating relationships to the different Clothing items. This ends up looking something like this, with a few variables that help with filtering and a photo for reference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this case, I would frame this part as the “Productive Friction” component. Before I was just collecting data and constraints, now this is combining these pieces into a greater whole that (hopefully) works out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though this solution is “good enough” for now, I can’t wait for Notion to develop an API to query these objects and relationships directly, or to programatically establish filters. Basically, my ideal would be to create a collection of items with tags, and then have those items laid out in a gallery so I could see them visually. As it stands, there’s still a bit too much friction. Additionally, the actual selection of a relationship is a bit cumbersome with the naming scheme that I developed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The manual way to do this is to create a view for a table, and then filter according to relationships. Unfortunately, since those filters can’t be assigned to a variable, the whole thing has to be done manually (as far as I know). The ideal would be to pass in a series of properties to the view that could manipulate the filter, but here we are.&lt;/p&gt;

Finally, actually making a day-to-day decision is tied to seeing those combinations and those other external needs. In other words, the need for planning. Filtering by the relevant constraint is the key here, organizing by one axis and filtering by another. I can take a look at the options and what I need for the day and make decisions on the margins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Calendaring is usable but a bit inefficient. This is an example of the past few days to test out this whole idea. Unfortunately, Notion lacks integration with Google calendar, so the calendar view itself ends up being quite limited.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What was useful (again, an API would be better) was filtering calendars by day, and then adding the view inline as shown below. This allows a trivial dashboard to be created, though again, it’s not particularly useful without a way to dig into the relations. The other frustrating piece is that these views seem to “reset” depending on other navigation you do within the database.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion&lt;/strong&gt;
Notion is a pretty impressive tool. It’s a great way to create content and build up something data-driven pretty quickly. Ultimately, it got me a lot further than I expected, but if the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.notion.so/Does-Notion-have-an-API-I-can-use-4541b07a5caa46dba0026624646118c0&quot;&gt;Notion public API wasn’t already a critical part of their roadmap&lt;/a&gt;, I would probably be trying to figure out how to export all this work and build a small custom solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;End of the day, a custom solution would be better, but as a catch all tool for personal organization or project management (eg. You can see in the screenshot that I’m also using Notion to plan and track these posts), I’m pretty happy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Getting to Outcomes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Technical details of how I’m approaching this aside, does it actually work?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m not sure yet. I’ve worn colours and individual pieces over the past few days which I haven’t touched in months. One pair of shoes had to be dusted off (though thankfully I’d taken good care of them previously). So only a few days in, I do feel like it is having an impact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My hope is to follow this pattern for a little while. This is where the additive practice part comes into play. A decade ago, I followed blogs like the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thesartorialist.com/&quot;&gt;The Sartorialist&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.facehunter.org/&quot;&gt;FaceHunter&lt;/a&gt;, but never understood quite how someone got from where I was to where some of the repeat subjects on those blogs found themselves. Now, I don’t feel that same need, but I do want to use what I have for the greatest utility and the greatest fun. In this case, it means the goal is to reduce my sense of decision fatigue and increase the variability and interest in what I wear. So I’ll practice. I’ll follow this post up in a few weeks or months with the outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[MA Thesis Idea on Innovation & Conflict]]></title><description><![CDATA[Security and Innovation are described as going hand-in-hand.

&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.popsci.com/technology/article/2013-05/ten-improvised-weapons-made-syrian-rebels/?image=8&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;Image from Popular Science&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Security and Innovation are described as going hand-in-hand. The logic is pretty simple: existential threats spur on unconventional allocation of resources towards R&amp;#x26;D to outpace the enemy at the national level, and lack of resources and necessity drives improvisation and innovation on the ground.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But how does it actually happen? In today’s asymmetric conflicts, we’ve seen terrifying effective innovations in IEDs, remote controlled weapons platforms, and conventional arms in the form of home-modified pickup trucks, drones with grenades, AK47 turrets controlled with a playstation controller, or even rudimentary autonomous weapons platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Overall Question&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With non-state (and clandestine) war-fighting and/or terrorist organizations that use violence to achieve political ends, are there observable models of TECHNICAL and MANAGEMENT innovation that occur across groups? In other words, are there consistent ways that technical and management problem solving emerges across orgs like AQI, the IRA, ISIS, the FSA, etc? Is there something inherent to the structure of these groups that produce a particular type of innovation?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What commonalities, advantages, and/or disadvantages do these models have when compared with models of innovation within conventional state-based war-fighting organizations? How might such models might be compared? Additionally, who are the catalysts and maintainers of these innovation cycles, and does this frame on value and innovation change our understanding of who catalyzes what in these organizations? What kinds of traits to these individuals share with other innovators in the private sector, academia, and government?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why this Topic?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was both shocked and fascinated by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/z4mmve/people-are-still-killing-each-other-with-diy-weapons-in-syria&quot;&gt;the remote gun platforms&lt;/a&gt; coming out of Syria and ISIS-occupied Mosul in Iraq. I come from a self-taught engineering and development background: building music and artwork with electronics and software that ultimately turned into a career in innovation and design. Those same skills that I learned in workshops or self-taught online are being applied in conflict zones. In my subsequent exploration, some of the techniques for building and sharing these creations felt a bit too familiar, and it sparked a broader curiosity. As such, my intent is to explore how and if there are consistent and observable ways that these innovations are created, disseminated, and scaled within and between organizations. One tangible example might the SVBIED factories that ISIS managed, and the way that &lt;a href=&quot;https://international-review.org/an-analysis-of-islamic-states-svbied-use-in-raqqa/&quot;&gt;the platforms evolved across the conflict and between cells&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why Me?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite a political science degree, I’ve worked for a decade in startups and innovation consulting. Working within both small and large organizations, I’ve tried to surface the interesting loops within human systems and to apply learning from systems thinking in what I build (eg. Donna Meadows, John Boyd, and more contemporary design thinking work). In this case, I want to do this research based off of the artifacts of the organizations instead of directly observing it as a consultant, employee, or ethnographer might. More broadly, I want to explore whether there is a certain inevitability in the innovation capacity of a business relative to its structure, and whether the same can be said the organizations I propose to study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Research Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope to leverage databases like &lt;a href=&quot;https://ctc.usma.edu/harmony-program/&quot;&gt;Westpoint’s Harmony DB&lt;/a&gt; (captured and translated management literature from terror orgs, especially AQI) and mimic some of the methodologies that Jacob Shapiro describes in &lt;a href=&quot;https://press.princeton.edu/books/hardcover/9780691157214/the-terrorists-dilemma&quot;&gt;The Terrorist’s Dilemma&lt;/a&gt;. I plan on leveraging as much social media content from YouTube, twitter, reddit, etc. as possible to try and understand timelines of “innovation” moving across groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I intend to capitalize on a starting point provided by an unclassified US Army report on remote and tele-operated weapons, the substantial reporting around these DIY weapons in Syria and Iraq, and forums like Reddit’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/shittytechnicals&quot;&gt;/r/ShittyTechnicals/&lt;/a&gt;. In addition, arms researchers like CalibreObscura have used methodologies that might be borrowed and learned from. It is unlikely that I will do interviews with current/former combatants for a variety of reasons, both ethical and practical.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Critical Lens&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doing this research in the international security studies context and still following the post-structural framing we’ve been introduced to so far is a point of some anxiety. I’m committed to take as empirical an approach as I can to this work, but I think the analysis of bureaucratic data might highlight interesting details on the “who” involved in these innovations. For example, how do these innovations shift power relationships and who serves to drive those innovations forward? Where are the inventors and makers coming from, and what kind of power do they hold within these organizations relative to others?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Wrapping Up&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, all this said, I’m excited to do this work. While many are still living the conflicts that birthed these deadly creations, the past decades of multi-party asymmetric conflict have left a trove of media and data to be considered in understanding just how technical and management innovation emerge in organizations to weak to engage in conventional warfare. My hope is this work can serve to make some small contribution in highlighting mechanisms to interdict the worst of these innovations, especially those used in the targeting of non-combatants.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Reflecting on 2019]]></title><description><![CDATA[2019 has been a weird combination of my most exhausting, fulfilling, chaotic, and structured year to date.

&lt;p&gt;2019 has been a weird combination of my most exhausting, fulfilling, chaotic, and structured year to date. Midway through 2018, I decided that I wouldn’t share anything until it was “done”, or at least passed a significant milestone. So while I usually don’t write posts like this, this year felt worth the reflection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Four Changes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Four big life changes happened this year, mostly set up in 2018.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, and most importantly, my son Emil joined us. Writing this, he’s eight months and two weeks old. He’s trying to figure out how to stand, can put himself to sleep, and the teeth are attempting to come through.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, I created &lt;a href=&quot;https://knowsi.com&quot;&gt;Knowsi&lt;/a&gt;, a small SaaS business to manage informed consent in research. You can sign up for a free account if you use consent forms in your work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Third, I started a (part-time) graduate program in International Security Studies at the University of Leicester. This is mostly inspired by my experience at the New America fellowship and at the Pentagon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fourth, I survived the fall, where all three of these came together with my consulting practice. Initially that survival was mostly a function of an unequal workload between myself and my wife, so not exactly sustainable or fair.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Baby – Emil&lt;/h2&gt;

      /&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the summer of 2018, I was back in the US for a few weeks and had just walked out of my NREMT exam when I called Ayla to tell her I’d passed. On the topic of positive test results, she shared that she was pregnant and everything started to shift. The remainder of that year became one of preparing for something neither of us really understood: in our bodies; our identities; our relationship to work, to the world, to each other, and to the son we hadn’t yet met.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Emil showed up on April 10th, 2019 at our home in Frederiksberg. For all the classes and reading and discussions of the previous months, I wasn’t even close to prepared. Since he’s arrived, every week has been different and every week forces something new learned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With some planning and savings, I was able to take three plus months of paternity leave. In this whirlwind of diapers and family visits, I learned a bit about how caring for Emil manifested as action: changing a diaper, giving him a bath, checking if he’s warm enough, making sure he’s fed (the first few times the confused look he gave me was incredible), rewatching the baby heimlich on YouTube for the 12th time. Cumulatively these little acts have started to paint a picture of fatherhood for me that I want to build upon — parenthood as a craft. Any craft requires practice and introspection and that’s been (more than anything else) the past eight and a half months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, I think this means taking the quotidian parts of parenthood incredibly seriously. Little actions done frequently build up over time, and so those little actions will contribute to who he becomes. But as important are the intuitions acquired after doing something many, many times, and using those intuitions to deal with the unknown and the unpredictable. We’ll see how this theory of parenthood changes, but at least for now this is the model I’m working with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Product – Knowsi&lt;/h2&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://knowsi.com&quot;&gt;Knowsi&lt;/a&gt; emerged from a conviction that consulting as I had been doing likely wasn’t the right path forward. Coming off of an extended consulting project that had seen me back-and-forth from the UK and fairly burnt out, I had been collecting and exploring different ideas (and savings) for a small, bootstrappable Software-as-a-Service business. My theory: knowing that Emil was on his way, I wanted to have something that could bring in income and support a working lifestyle that would let me be present.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I settled on Knowsi from a host of other ideas while flying into Paris for New Years 2019. Consent management had always been a challenge in user research, with lost forms and disempowered participants. As a user researcher myself, I knew the problem well and had seen when it goes wrong. It was a discrete need, something that I was solving for myself, and was feasible with my skillset as an indie developer and designer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spent the next few months getting it off the ground, piloting it with the the Copenhagen Institute of Interaction Design, and rapidly turning it into something that worked, could be used, etc. When Emil was born, I took a few months off, and my diaper changing speed improved considerably . Unfortunately, Knowsi didn’t progress much in that time, but I got my first customer and it was a huge boost in morale. In the fall, Ayla and I did a complete redesign of the site and relaunched it, and from there have figured out a good pattern of collecting feedback (and responding quickly to bugs), setting priorities, and aggressively pushing on particular features through time-bound sprints.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than anything else though, I found that working on a business (vs a product) solo is maybe more trouble than its worth. While I can do most of the product work and some of the business, the constant focus switching is to to the detriment of the actual work. Also my marketing skills are useless. So in the new year, I intend to re-focus on Knowsi and seek collaboration and help from friends, colleagues, or people who share a similar excitement for qualitative research and privacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, I also just launched free subscription tier to support students and solo researchers in gathering and maintaining consent with their research participants. So if you’ve been curious about what I’ve been working on but didn’t want to put in a credit card, &lt;a href=&quot;https://knowsi.com/join&quot;&gt;now you can use Knowsi for free&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      /&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This has been a long time coming. I’ve flirted with graduate school for years. In 2012, I’d been accepted to NYU’s ITP program and almost moved to New York. However, after months of soul searching, I ended up saying no because didn’t want to be in that kind of debt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since then, I’ve had a lot of fun: starting two businesses, working at IDEO, at the Pentagon, being a think tank fellow, and currently living a slightly charmed independent consulting/product person’s life in Denmark. But every single year I start musing about returning to school, though that idea of what I would return FOR has shifted over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coming out of my Public Interest Tech fellowship with New America last year, I had started to explore working more deeply in issues surrounding the refugee crisis, climate change, and a more systemic view of security. Technology skills are great and useful, but I believe that to really be effective (and not harmful), I needed to shore up my knowledge of the issues and the critical discourse. So after many conversations, explorations, and books read, I landed on Security Studies as a field.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite my career in code and design, my academic roots are in political science, so I had (rusty) familiarity with the topic. I ended up reaching out to my former professor, Renan Levine. I actually hadn’t had particularly good grades in Professor Levine’s classes, but I reached out to him because he had a massive impact on my transition into design. Specifically, he taught me how to visualize my thinking, how to approach it systematically, and how to use externalized ideation as a lever for creativity. Weirdly, I believe what I learned in his research, policy, and statistics classes became my entryway into interaction design and entrepreneurship. And despite nearly a decade between his classes and my application, he wrote my recommendation letters that helped me get into a security studies MA in the UK. (So thank you Renan and Matt Cutts for the letters of recommendation!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I’ve just wrapped up the first term and starting to think about my dissertation. I have difficulty expressing how excited I am for the whole enterprise. Life would be a lot easier without this as I have to be incredibly structured in my time: I’m often up till two or three in the morning, and it has meant getting creative with the day-to-day of the household (which I’ll talk about next). But even a few months in I feel like what I’m learning is surfacing new areas to explore and a new way for me to understand the issues that I care about, but have struggled to act on.&lt;/p&gt;

      /&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, survival. This year has had a lot to do with privilege. My wife and I have benefited from the Danish child care policies. I had access to personal capital, skills, and time to start a small business. I had a network and the time to apply for a university. I had the network and skills to be selective in what I do work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite this, the past year has been the busiest in my life. Keeping up with friends and social engagements has been a struggle. Beyond even the normal limits to sleep that new parents face, to get everything done I’ve had an unhealthy number of nights with just four to six hours of sleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dealing with multiple responsibilities: Emil, working with Knowsi customers, consulting as a product manager with IKEA, leading design mentorship with the Innofounder accelerator program, and finally, acclimating to my grad program. When all of those came together in September, I managed to burn out in a few weeks and things weren’t working. I didn’t see failure as an option though, and I was able to figure out some new techniques for time management and tracking everything. It involved late nights, but nothing really slipped — or at least that’s what I initially thought.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this initial “balance”, I unfairly relied on my wife to pick up slack that I wasn’t seeing or was dramatically de-prioritizing. &lt;a href=&quot;https://slate.com/human-interest/2018/03/women-are-overburdened-with-their-families-mental-loads.html&quot;&gt;A weakness in our household dynamic that had existed previously at a lower level&lt;/a&gt; was suddenly becoming exacerbated by these new stressors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since that first month of chaos, we’ve been working together to figure out how to balance that better. Ayla and I have always used our skills as designers and managers to do the work of creating a good relationship and life together. So figuring out “okay, what does it mean to be equal NOW?” became a question that we were at least equipped to ask and start to figure out together. One tangible example worth mentioning is this (flawed but useful as a starting point) method in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/44071899-fair-play&quot;&gt;Fair Play&lt;/a&gt; book. As a way of visualizing the unseen tasks (an issue for me), it’s been effective. Given the speed at which Emil’s needs change, we have a standing meeting every week to figure out how our needs are changing alongside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, a willingness to share, visualize, and design the hard conversations by way of whiteboard, post-it, and through artifact goes a long way. If you’ve got a background in service design and facilitation, turning those skills on yourself and your relationships is incredibly worthwhile (albeit painful sometimes). If we hadn’t had these skills to begin with, I suspect we wouldn’t have been able to surface the need to have these conversations as quickly as we did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What Didn’t Work&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a few things this year that didn’t quite work out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As a &lt;strong&gt;consultant&lt;/strong&gt;, I (purposefully) brought in a lot less revenue than I normally do. I’m fortunate to be able to even make the decision to work less and make less, but still, it was a dip from previous years and I felt a fair bit of emotional stress even with it being intentional.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As a &lt;strong&gt;startup design mentor&lt;/strong&gt;, I dropped the ball this autumn. Despite successful workshops facilitated and some great reviews from my teams, I wasn’t nearly as present or available as I had been previously. Unfortunately, I’ve decided that this is the piece won’t get any better down the road, so I’ve decided to step back from leading the Design Mentorship at the Innofounder program.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As a &lt;strong&gt;friend&lt;/strong&gt;, I was never around. Part of this is a function of adult life for anyone, but I was conspicuously absent from group chats, drinks, parties, and general hangouts. Even when friends came to visit, I often had to truncate my time to work on an essay or deal with work. I haven’t figured out how to be better at this yet.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As an &lt;strong&gt;indie dev/founder/whatever&lt;/strong&gt;, I got distracted chasing shiny things a few times. For example, instead of focusing on Knowsi, I spent a few weeks building an MVP of a product called &lt;a href=&quot;https://fitfaj.com&quot;&gt;FitFaj&lt;/a&gt;, a customized training plan for expectant fathers. There are a few people using it actually, but I really should not have done this.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I started &lt;strong&gt;studying Arabic&lt;/strong&gt; in the Spring of 2019 after almost six months of trying to get into an Arabic language school in Copenhagen. I’d initially been studying Danish, and abandoned it when the state-supported language centres were defunded. I’ve also been studying pretty consistently with a tutor from &lt;a href=&quot;https://natakallam.com/&quot;&gt;Natakallam&lt;/a&gt;. However, I honestly don’t feel like I’ve gotten that far, and having just finished my most recent textbook, I’m struggling to figure out what the next step is. Regardless, the language itself is immensely interesting, and being able to read the script and understand some basics has me excited to figure out how to continue.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Things that Did Work&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nutrition&lt;/strong&gt; was a bit of the bass rhythm for this year. I think I would have struggled without it. I started following a keto diet in 2018, and am doing a keto-like thing with just low carbs (no one should be denied lentils and bananas). In general, the keto diet was ridiculous and I wouldn’t recommend it. It worked well for me, with the greatest payoff being consistent energy and no spikes of fatigue mid-day. On the negative, it meant my eating habits were incredibly inflexible, and if I didn’t get the right vitamin and electrolyte mix, I’d feel like I was dying. However, it set up a framework for me to do a less restrictive but still low carb diet incredibly easily, so it was an effective habit maker.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fitness&lt;/strong&gt; has been a bigger piece: I’ve been following a series of plans by the &lt;a href=&quot;https://mtntactical.com/&quot;&gt;Mountain Tactical Institute&lt;/a&gt; folk, and have really enjoyed them. I also got certified as a personal trainer (I use certifications to learn about things like this, also because of the FitFaj diversion). I don’t really follow my own plans (though have been making plans for others), but it has really helped make sense of the why and how of others’ plans, specifially the MTI ones. That knowledge has also motivated me to exercise with a consistency that I’ve never been able to keep before, about 6x a week.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Zeroing out my &lt;strong&gt;email&lt;/strong&gt; inbox is a obnoxious and terrible, but it’s been a primary technique for keeping on top of what’s coming in. Combined with a obsessive todo list keeping (I use Things3, but anything works, including paper), it has permitted an offloading and addressing of things in bite-sized chunks, and opened up more space for actually doing work. It’s far from perfect, but for whatever reason having unaddressed emails and tasks like that creates either avoidance or stress.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Acknowledging &lt;strong&gt;cycles&lt;/strong&gt;. This one was and is hard. I can work intensely and well in cycles, and then need to reset. This manifests as days of working quite passionately like a maniac, then needing a day or three of not doing really anything. When I fall out of these productive cycles, it manifests as my sleep schedule being out of whack, one of my core habits (like the inbox thing, or fitness) slipping, or feeling kind of anxious. This year, I feel like I finally got a handle on these cycles in a way that has made me a lot more effective.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Remote Work&lt;/strong&gt;. I cannot express how effective working remotely or semi-remotely is. I can be present with Emil, instead of commuting I can go to the gym, I get a massive amount more done, and the socializing and networking part of working becomes something that is more designed and less imposed. It requires noise canceling headphones and clear boundaries, but those headphones can be removed if you’re needed. It also requires a set of tools and technologies that really have to be tailored to each situation, and developed in collaboration with your team. Anyway, I hope to mostly work in remote or semi-remote context going forward, both to be around for Emil more, but also simply to get more done.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Going into 2020&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what does 2020 look like? Honestly, I don’t know yet, and to the point of my “don’t share until there’s a milestone” thing, I’ll share when it’s time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In general, Emil is starting at daycare in the new year,so I’m going to modify my &lt;a href=&quot;http://shop.larryvsharry.com/&quot;&gt;Bullitt bike&lt;/a&gt; for daily dropoff and figure out my sleep schedule. I’m continuing to work on Knowsi, and want to explore ways to put more time into it and my customers. I’m continuing to consult with IKEA, and work with a burgeoning team there that honestly, I can’t wait to share more about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beyond that though, we’ll see. In a week, this post itself went from “I need to write a reflection” to “I want to share that reflection” to “I need to make that blog finally” to “maybe I should just redo my site as a blog.” So… here we are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m going to be writing and posting more this year, plus there’s a maybe project with a friend from Toronto if you’re interested in international relations, politics, and design. So if you’re able, please subscribe to the update newsletter below!&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
